Hi guys,

Quick recap of the discussion -

We can look at the relationships between:

- Yelp: Number of reviews
- Yelp: Text sentiment of reviews
- Yelp: Stars of reviews
- City Data: Various other interesting city data (transport, crime rate, employment etc.)

On Monday, we should answer the follow questions with Prof. Bonneau further:

- Size of the dataset
- Look into the above metrics and see what we want to test out
- Resources we mentioned in the discussion:

Yelp Dataset: http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge (40,000+ business, 1M+ reviews)
Python NLTK: http://www.nltk.org/

Thanks,
Jason
