But with minimum competition; ok, perhaps a couple of places that might cater to similar style as this place nearby, I felt duty bound to find out if they were the best in the area, my luck was in early June.\n\nThe party I was invited to had actually won the entire wedding through a local Haddington newspaper. Well almost, they still have to iron out some creases, but hey when weddings cost as they certainly do, then it really pays to get this on. So thanks to the Courier as the organiser!\n\nThe decor inside the Quayside is dark wood, deep pile red-ish carpets, in and around the small bar downstairs, but past reception is their restaurant. Another bar upstairs on first floor and another on level 2. There is a lift for people that don't fancy or can't do the walk, but it's not that quick!\n\nWith adequate parking to the rear and side of the venue overlooking the harbour, it really pays to park as close to the venue as possible, especially as it rained heavily on the day in question, so it kind of ruined those precious wedding photos!\n\nWedding food was faultless but was it really that price(\u00a375each according to the Bride's father), but we did get champs upon reception. Red and White wine with the dinner, roast chicken and haggis tower was a treat, as was choco pudding and cream (in the shape of a heart). With all that booze flowing some of our party later on just wanted a cup of tea, so when I requested this, the staff couldn't have been more accommodating, so top marks for producing a pot or two when they didn't really have to!\n\nFood booking drinks ambience were great, but you need three rules. 1. some ill placed seating meant my back was to the bridal table during speeches. To any future brides out there, save guests having a crick in the neck, check the table layout. 2. To make your perfect wedding even better, please get a band. 3. With reception closed well before 1am also make sure you prebook a taxi or this may incur a lengthy wait at the nearest taxi rank or bus stop.\n\nSpeaking of food, Quayside renamed their restaurant as the \"World Buffet\",(does exactly as is says). The name conjures up horrors of many a fast food joint. But with many foods available (and I did ask what they didn't produce) to which the answer was - no to fruit. But I ask you, after unlimited buffet food not many peeps will have room for fruit anyhow?\n\nRequiring another visit to experience since I was there for a wedding so couldn't appreciate this mass buffet experience. My mission should I choose to accept it is to find out, but if  the wedding food was anything to go by, they'll probably be ok???\n\nWorld Banq, musselburgh - One place many cuisines, all for \u00a38.50, you try you decide?", "business_id": "FBzPxHL9tJYGw0uckrv3vg", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-06-05", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "6GiCNlObz5jWy9PPSAXP7A", "review_id": "oeMJPWvKvdPpBO_-jb-ONQ", "text": "We went here to have a Christmas night with a group.\n\nBar prices were ok but the barmaid was a bit ditsy with the order and kept asking what we ordered!\n\nFood, \"Meh I've experienced FAR better\".

Really, I think this place deserves 3.5 stars - definitely not a 3 but not ready for a 4 yet. But I want to give it positive vibes, as I think that the Birdcage is a fab addition to Musselburgh. If you can find it, that is. Be warned, it's off the main drag, in a semi-industrial estate (it's a converted cotton mill) and in the dark, an absolute bugger to find (first road on the left by the job centre, folks). I had all but given up when I saw my friend run out of her car, so followed her into a pedestrian quadrant where the Birdcage sat. \n\nIt's a very modern bar and restaurant, serving pretty modern dishes that are really rather unheard of in this town. Balsamic roasted beetroot with goats cheese and rocket salad? How on earth does that fit in with the local chippy? I don't think it does, but really, honestly and truly not a bad thing. Sadly, said salad didn't have the flavour I was expecting, the beetroot and rocket both overpowered by the cheese, and the vinegar didn't carry over any flavour at all, so I was a little disappointed, although overall it was a pleasant salad. \n\nMy main was a gnocchi (home made by the looks of it) with wild mushroom, drizzled with truffle oil. A little greasy for my liking, but I find mushroom dishes to be generally more greasy, so you can take that comment with a pinch of salt. My friend's angus burger and chips looked fabulous, and meaty (both chips and burger). \n\nWe both went all out with dessert - chocolate fondant for her, and sticky toffee pudding for me. Not something I normally order, but damn, the flavours were outstanding, with toffee and cinammon screaming out. Sponge itself was a little dry. \n\nSo you can probably see why this is a 3.5 star. Although the food was good, it wasn't amazing or hit the level of sophistication that this place is striving for. However, I don't want Birdcage to fail - perhaps, as it hasn't been open too long, it just needs to stretch its wings out a little more and will improve in time. I think that now that I have the option of old mans pub or trendy bar in my hometown as well, that I will be definitely back to drink some more here too, beats a bus ride into Edinburgh on a dark wintery night.", "business_id": "-rs3Rufq-9jy8z3eWWNd-Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-12", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}, "user_id": "-ZtHkOGsagtYTsx0J8Trbw", "review_id": "9o9EafEkVtsuPqK93jObsg", "text": "Another hidden gem - you would not know it was there!
