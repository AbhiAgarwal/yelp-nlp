Whether you see that as an indication of how good this place is, or of how sad I am is up to you... but you should definitely eat there before you decide.\n\nWe went for their 2-Course lunch deal for \u00a35.95, as we just happened to be walking past and were given a flyer. We did not regret it... although I am now extremely full!\n\nI usually steer clear of indian restaurants as I often find the food can be very greasy and stodgy, and very often it all tastes the same. None of that is true about this place: the starter is automatically brought to you (you don't get to choose it yourself), although the waiter did ask us if we were vegetarians first. He brought us thinly sliced potatoes which had been fried in a lovely combination of spices until crispy, although I'm not going to pretend for a second that I know what they were. Alongside these we each got a huge chunk of tandoori grilled chicken and an equally massive chunk of chicken marinated in their own unique spice blend, with a side salad and home-made raita.\n\nI'm not sure if it was the selection of mains or my boyfriend's almond and saffron lassi which was the ultimate winner, but the mains definitely played a huge part in it: there was a buffet with 4 different curry dishes - a tadka dal, a tandoori lamb curry, a veggie sweet potato & spinach curry and the best one of all... chicken cooked with cashew nut paste, roast tomatoes, garlic and green chillies. Oh. Yes.\n\nOf course, this all came with an unlimited supply of green salad, home-made mango chutney, 2 flavours of home-made poppadums and as much home-made naan bread as you can eat. As for the lassi, you need to go and try that for yourself - at \u00a31.75 it's an absolute steal.\n\nThe best thing about all this was the bill. For two of us to eat more than, in all probability, was healthy for that time of the day, a lassi, a beer and large bottle of mineral water we paid just \u00a317.\n\nIf you like indian food, or even think you might do but you're still not sure, I can't recommend this place highly enough.", "business_id": "5dUDkaxm5FdQanoNkP86KQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-04-12", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "KmZ9l-NoWdJJ3CG_euUJRA", "review_id": "goEyjcuFQyWGNf41XefpUA", "text": "If you are ever in the mood for a decent Indian meal, Suruchi is the place to go.\n\nSituated in the centre of the busy and bustling Nicolson Street, Suruchi is just around the corner from the main University campus, George Square and is a short walk from the city centre and so it is a convenient place to reach.  The restaurant looks pretty small from the outside, but inside it stretches back quite far and is able to accommodate a lot of customers. \n\nSuruchi's menu offers a wide selection of authentic Indian cuisine and I ordered the seafood soup to start which was truly amazing - made with really fresh ingredients and tasted super fresh - yummy! I then had the butter chicken for my main which was equally as amazing and the chicken was cooked perfectly and there was no excess layer of oil on the sauce which I sometimes find with Indian dishes. There are warnings on the menu indicating which dishes are mild and which are hot which always gets a big thumbs up from me as you won't get your head blown off by an unexpected chili. \n\nThe prices are really reasonable here with most main meal curry's costing about six pounds, and there is a lunch deal available too where a two course meal costs \u00a36 - what a bargain!

The architecture is just breathtaking and truly unique. I actually believe it was a Knight of Templar meeting house rather than a chapel which it was later converted to during Victorian times or the mid to late 1800s. The tour guides were informative and enjoyable to speak to. This chapel also reveals evidence that the Scots were in the Americas long before Christopher Columbus. The triflora and maize symbols inside the chapel show that there was a  connection between the Scots and 1st nation peoples of N. America. There are many green man symbols as well as various flora and faunas designs throughout the chapel. I would not miss it if I were passing near the area as it holds some astonishing history of Scotland and is a gem of a place- even the grounds around the chapel near the old graveyard and fields are nice to visit and just relax. The only downside is that there is a lot of construction going on outside so it is hard to take good pics of some of the external architecture. You are not able to take photos of the inside. In the chamber downstairs there are headstones and other old stone items taken from various places in Scotland. However one of these headstones has a unique story on the history of black death or the bubonic plague. On one side of the stone a child has been carved and is shown keeping their feet off the ground or from getting bitten by a tick, and on the other side this same child is shown as a skeleton awaiting death. The God of Death also appears on a different area of the stone as the Grim Reaper ready to take the soul of the child.

He found the goats cheese and beetroot too sweet for his taste, and I found my squid incredibly greasy and a bit too salty for my taste, though well cooked and overall tasty.  My starter was also so huge that I gave half of it away.\n\nMy main was venison loin with a mini game pie, and The Man went for one of the specials with beef shin and a small slice of lasagne.  My venison was gorgeous and the pie was lovely though I personally would have preferred a veg in its place.

Alarm bells were already ringing  as we left after this brief visit. We went on the first day of service and were told upon trying to order drinks that one of only two lagers on tap were off. Before even receiving our drinks the manager came to take our food order. We were only there for bar snacks, for which the menu had not yet been prepared. The manager recited the bar menu from memory and we ordered chicken breast nachos and chips.\n\nAbout 15 minutes later our (incorrect) drinks order arrived. After being left for roughly 40 minutes in an empty restaurant, our food eventually arrived. This is when the wait became self evident. The nachos were an obviously hastily assembled plate of nacho chips, topped with, instead of the advertised salsa, sweet chilli dressing (me neither) and cold grated cheddar, despite the plate being piping hot. There is a Tesco 5 minutes down the road, go figure. The chips were served hot yet still raw in the middle. Asking for the bill we had to wait a further 10-15 minutes for the bar staff to calculate the cost on a calculator in the absence of a working till.\n\nStupidly, despite this, we gave them the benefit of the doubt. It was opening night, places have hiccups, these things happen. And continued to happen, in our case.\n\nWe returned four days later for our Birthday celebration. The Birthday guest was Vegan. With such a strict dietary requirement we always give plenty notice and forewarning. Being told that this was no problem and would be noted alongside our booking, it was disappointing to find that there had been absolutely no communication with the kitchen and the Birthday guest was offered either \"vegetables\"(?!) or beetroot risotto. Interchangeable as starter and main. \n\nWith such a dizzying array of options, she chose the indeterminable serving of \"vegetables\" for starters and the beetroot risotto for mains. The vegetable starter was a minuscule and completely unremarkable serving of cold, oily roasted aubergine and pepper with some green leaves. It wasn't bad but there wasn't anything to get wrong. The beetroot risotto was a horrid plate of completely tasteless, lukewarm, gelatinous rice pudding, coloured with what seemed to be purple food dye and surrounded by a neon green liquid.  \n\nFor the rest of us, we ordered the soup; Leek and Potato. It was, again, unremarkable and initially served with 3 slices of burnt melba toast and then, bizarrely followed up with half a baguette five minutes later. The goats cheese ciabatta was nice enough but nothing you couldn't easily make at home. I ordered the \"Gravadlax of Wester Ross Salmon, Pickled Cucumber, Lemon, Wholemeal Bread & Dill mayo\" (after being told that the fish mezze I had wanted was no longer available on the dinner menu after only four days of opening) which ended up consisting of a couple insultingly thin wafers of salmon served without any lemon, pickled cucumber or wholemeal bread but I did get an overly acidic \"dill mayo'\n\nMains consisted of the aforementioned flavourless and stodgy beetroot concoction. The other two diners ordered the chargrilled aubergine which also came without half of the ingredients advertised on the menu. I had the duck breast, which again, bore no resemblance to the menu description and instead of dauphinois potato, was served with a disgusting, saccharine, green coloured mash.\n\nComing to over \u00a3125 (without even being charged for the inedible risotto!) made this an unmitigated disaster of an evening. As if this was not bad enough, we received a phone call four days later from the manager to say that their 'debit merchant' was unable to take our card payment without proof of us being in the restaurant and requested secure card details over the phone!\n\nThe staff were very nice, apologetic and understanding but the rest of the experience did nothing to instil any faith in this establishment. It was like an evening spent as unwitting extras in an episode of Fawlty Towers.

When I saw a great Groupon deal here, I went for it and was really excited about it. The staff were very businesslike on the phone and booked me in, sending a handy email confirmation. On our appointed day, a Sunday evening, we made the easy 15 minute drive from the city centre to the castle. Oh how glad I was that I had a friend with a car who was driving us! Although there is a bus stop near the top of the driveway, the driveway itself is about a mile long in the pitch darkness and really shouldn't be attempted to walk at night. It was spooky enough in the car!\n\nWhen we arrived, the castle was beautiful and imposing, but we were surprised to see that there was only one other car in the large parking lot! Well, our own private castle for the night? Don't mind if I do.\n\nWhen we went in, we admired the gorgeous entryway and lobby of the hotel. The staff behind the desk escorted us to the bar since we were a bit early for dinner. We enjoyed some lovely but expensive drinks (\u00a33 for a half pint of Peroni on tap... Prices for a lord I guess) in the library bar. The bar was full of  all of the dishes from what had apparently been a very busy afternoon tea that day. Apparently there was another voucher for that. Overlooking that, we enjoyed poking around and seeing the library and sitting room which had really interesting decor, books and paintings.\n\nWhen it was time for dinner, the staff again escorted us along, and we went downstairs (into the wine cellar or dungeon?). The decor down there felt a bit like a pub with large booths. We had our choice of tables - we were the only ones there and the only ones who had booked. We chose a nice big booth by the heater. \n\nI had prawns for the starter and they were served pleasantly on a slate board and were delicious. The balmoral chicken was good, but not the best one I've ever had and the whisky sauce wasn't really to my liking - other whisky cream sauces have been much better. Dessert was supposed to be a chocolate mousse cake but was really like a big chocolate brownie cake and I had ice cream on the side. It was indeed yummy but I would have liked a mousse layer over the chocolate cake which is what I was expecting.\n\nWe had a lovely evening at Melville Castle and other people (guests of the hotel?) did come to the restaurant later so at least we weren't the only ones all evening. I enjoyed exploring Melville Castle and exploring it a bit, but I was a bit surprised when we asked about its history that he staff didn't know much about it. We had a good time, but the food and dining experience was more like a gastro-pub experience than a fine dining experience at a castle. For the same prices, you get much better food elsewhere but I guess you pay for the castle experience!

My sister opted for hers a la mode. They were steaming hot--so, my sister had the right idea. It was a sugar-ultra-high!!! The consistency was fairly rigid due to the deep-fry, but the Mars bar was definitely mushy & melted inside. Tasted like a donut & a chocolate bar. You could clearly determine that what you were eating was BAD for you! My sister's b-friend said he ended up getting a head ache, and his teeth started hurting--his teeth!!\n\nAll in all it was an experience.  I think a la mode is the way to go, because the creaminess of the ice cream sort of helps cushion the sugar blow which smacks you upside your head.\n\nOh, and I don't think you're limited to Mars bars here.  You can try other forms of candy.

I wanted that, but since I wasn't very hungry, I ended up sharing curry fish & chips with Mel - and those were absolutely delicious. The curry wasn't very spicy, which suited me well - I can't handle anything hot at all, I just die. But our friend Billy, ended up having haggis again - thus the \"Double Haggis\". Plus, it was DEEP FRIED HAGGIS. Anything deep fried just can't be bad. So while Billy enjoyed his meal with gusto, Mel and I watched on horrified* as he ate more \"sheep's pluck\", just deep fried. At least he enjoyed it! Definitely a fun place - it just lost one star because there weren't many places to sit.\n\n*horrified may be a bit exaggerated. It was more of an awestruck look.

There's this new thing out where they have a big stack chicken breast on a big pole and they slice it off just like the doner kebab. The meat is delicious and you get loads of it, even though I only ordered a small one. \n\nAnyway, I got into my car and had a few forkfuls of it before starting the engine. I place the polystyrene container on my dashboard and slowly started making my way through Edinburgh on my way home. To go west you first have to go east and around the roundabout at the Omni Centre. Well, half way around the roundabout the kebab slid right across the dashboard and emptied itself in the passenger footwell. What a bummer!\n\nI had the taste in my mouth now so I had to go back and buy another one. The chippy has loads of food all ready for buying and there are plenty of staff members to keep the queue to a minimum. There are a few tables for customers who don't want to go home yet, and have another drink with their food. \n\nI headed home and decided to have a mouthful of kebab everytime I came to a red light. Well, it was as if I was in a royal motorcade because all I got were green lights all the way out.

I went for the quail (more for the novelty than anything) and for those who've not had quail... meh, it's alright I guess. This is purely down to a consequence of the meat itself and not the cooking or presentation of it - it was cooked well and has quite a satisfying meaty taste, there's just not much of it. I would have much rather had the wings...\n\nFor mains we both went for Karahis, I got the chicken and he got the lamb. Mine was better. For the uninitiated, a Karahi is a cooking pot which is used in the preparation of the dish - just so you know... (EDUCATIONAL REVIEWS!) The dishes themselves were mightily tasty with a nice mix of spice and flavour  - not bland and hot like many other curries, really quite delicate whilst potent. Oh hello ginger, thanks for that flavour explosion in my mouth! (I love ginger) - accompaniments in the form of rice and naan were satisfying but somewhat short of being noteworthy.\n\nAnd hey, how could we not at least give mention to BYOB with no corkage. Simply brilliant.\n\nThe fly in the ointment and the reason for four stars in place of five? Well firstly the lamb in the Karahi was a little tough and (although still quite tasty) hadn't been cooked anywhere long enough to let it come close to being as good as the chicken. Secondly... \u00a34.90 for two popadoms and dips?!  I even went and checked online to make sure we hadn't been jipped and true enough there it is plain as day...

We looked into several restaurants, but one in particular stood out, and that is 21212.\n\nThe name is derived from the structure of the menu; for each of the five courses you either have 1 or 2 options. You have 2 options for your starter, 1 soup, 2 main courses, 1 cheese selection and 2 desserts. Simple!\n\nThe restaurant received a Michelin Star within 8 months of opening, and by looking on their website you'll see the masses of other awards they have achieved...and with good reason!\n\nIt's stunningly decorated - decorated like a boudoir almost. The walls are hidden by silky curtains and the chandelier in the centre of the room gives the room a patterned glow. The seats are a massive upholstered booth that stretches to the end of the room, adorned with cushions to break up seating spaces. When we arrived it was quiet - too quiet - and we were worried about being too loud. You can see the kitchen from the restaurant and the chefs are working away - quiet, intricate and composed. It busied up quickly and there was conversation in the air. I relaxed a bit then!\n\nThe staff are very attentive and so welcoming. I was having a chat with a lovely woman at the end...turned out to be the co-owner! As well as warm, I found everyone very knowledgable and they gave us very clear breakdowns on the food we were being served, as there were several components to each dish.\n\nWe started with Beef a la Grecque - To describe this would be impossible. there were so many different element s to it! Slow cooked beef, ratatouille, parsnips, apricots and feta, egg omelette, Brazil nuts, cucumber and yoghurt, anchovy, garlic and rosemary. It was also served with a little tub of aubergine pur\u00e9e. I'm not going to even try to describe it because there are just no words. The beef was rare, thinly cut and just ridiculously tender. I was in awe eating this. Read the ingredients. Imagine them together. It was incredible! \n\nThe soup was a vegetable soup. This vegetable soup was unlike any soup I've ever tasted. It was delicious! It was formed over three layers: vegetable pur\u00e9e, a layer of vegetables and then peas pudding on top with a decorative froth. The portions are tiny, rightly so, but with the soup I genuinely wish there was at least double. The absolutely mouth watering flavour just blows you away and you feel addicted to it!\n\nThe main course was Trout , Cauliflower & Pasta with Smoked Cheese - Delicate, oven baked pink trout fillets, smoked pasta and cauliflower cheese bake, celery, sprouts, white cabbage and pak choi. Served with Dijon mustard mayonnaise, sesame seeds and pine nuts. I absolutely love cheese, especially smoked cheese and added to cauliflower and delicate, rare trout. Oh it was just lovely!\n\nThe cheeses served were: Old Winchester, Manchego, Clava, Abondance, Bleu d'Auvergne,Hansi, Langres, Sainte Maure, Ticklemore, Montenegro and Rocamadour. The waiter explained each cheese and it was really interesting to listen to. He knew and seemed interested in what he was talking about and gave us trivia about where and how each was made! The stack of biscuits and crackers gave variety and atop the stack was shortbread. If you're like me and mouldy cheese isn't your thing then you'll love this: shortbread takes the taste away completely! Does everyone know this? I found it amazing!\n\nFestive Egg Coconut Custard Nog was the dessert - Glazed festive egg custard, crushed shortbread, meringue, sultanas, nutmeg, golden pears and pecans, fresh mincemeat pur\u00e9e, yoghurt, coconut anglaise with a hint of rosemary.\n\nThe presentation of this was something I loved - the coloured pieces placed on top of the custard matched the restaurant logo. I found it cute. The shot glass contained a layered gathering of the nutmeg and yoghurt as mincemeat with the frothy topping, and the custard was served in the rectangle dish with a lovely crispy glaze. It was served with a collection of popcorn and orange zest.\n\nI had an amazing experience here.. The food was spectacular but the staff made it for me! I just LOVED everything about my meal here.\n\nPlease see the full review and photographs here: http://wp.me/p2vpGr-fc", "business_id": "jKeorIe_lmk-fBB_NXPs7A", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-05-05", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 7, "cool": 4}, "user_id": "MQ1QQ8WVVAI3EZpMyP_6yg", "review_id": "S4T1OoA6_qJVwm09SeMhzA", "text": "This has got to be one of thee least well known out of the very few michelin star restaurants in Edinburgh and I really don't know why?!?!

First port of call when I returned home was find good Thai in Edinburgh. Thai Pod ticked the 'take-away home delivery' box.\n\nThe menu online is huge. I spent at least an hour drifting my eyes up and down, up and down trying to decide what to have. The online ordering system is pretty nifty. You order online as you go, and when you choose an option you can then select the filling (and there's a lot: chicken, beef, duck, cod, fish, prawns, mixed seafood, tofu and veg, just veg and others), and then for every dish, your level of preferred spice (5 different levels). I know some people don't like spice, so this is a great option.\n\nThere's also a count-down timer on the website for the food to arrive. They do warn, and make explicit, that waiting time for delivery is 70 minutes and for us it was 80 minutes. I knew this when I ordered, so was not disappointed, but it is worth taking note of. I can imagine people getting frustrated and giving negative comments or reviews on long waiting times, but they make it fully explicit on the website several times this is the case. I think they cook every dish from scratch which is why it can take so long.\n\nSo, to the food. As my date is veggie, I sacrificed my usual meat option and went for a tofu stir-fry, she had the tofu green curry, and we had a side of the spinach, side of coconut batter sweet potato and many crackers. Oh and coconut rice.\n\nIt was takeaway so the standard wasn't as high as restaurants. And it was tasty and quite fresh. But it felt quite oily, or perhaps loaded with MSG and I felt quite nasty the next day. I had leftovers and ate them that night, and again the next day felt a bit yucky. This is probably the MSG, as the food itself was ok and I don't think it made me ill. But I remember ravenously devouring it but now can't remember why or how it tasted, so methinks they are heavy-handed on the chemical additives. This could not be the case but for me, I wasn't in awe of the food itself.\n\nPerhaps the dine in option produces a better standard of food, but having tried many other Thais in Edinburgh now I do think this is probably the lowest quality so far.

Already a well-established chain in England, it was somewhere I would seek out purposefully when visiting friend's down South. And I always ended up with a wee box of Hotel Chocolat chocolates for my birthday or Christmas from those friends.\n\nIt just opened a few weeks ago but already was full with eager customers. The patient, friendly staff member standing with a platter of taster chocolates was very sweet, as were the chocolates themselves.\n\nThe chocolates on offer were brimming over from shelves, stands and displays. Hotel Chocolat have their own plantations out in S Luca. They are a branded chain store but not in a soulless way. THe packaging is quite simple on the standard bags of chocolates, but the chocolates themselves are anything but simple.\n\nI don't think my words will do justice to the chocolate they sell. Go in, try a sample, buy some. Adore. It's not cheap, it's definitely a treat, present or generous stocking filler. But it's goooood. and they have many different flavours and types of chocolate to buy. They even have chocolate spreads, hot chocolates (one with chilli) and savoury chocolate sauce to go with lamb dishes and the like. We're talking Artisan chocolate here.\n\nThe one noticeable difference for this store is, attached to the message on the windows of \"Coffee vs Chocolate\", they have a small caf\u00e9 space up the back where you can order tea, coffee, hot chocolate and 'chocolate-coffee'. What, you might ask, is that? You can have a latte, capucino or americano made with ground cocoa beans rather than coffee beans. It isn't sweet, it's not chocolate as we know it to eat, and you can add your own sugar, but it's a different way of drinking chocolate. I didn't try one myself,yet, but I am very intrigued! A playful, tasty concept.\n\nMy only worry is that now my southern friends won't feel the need to include a wee box of Hotel Chocolat delights in each present now that they know it's within easy reach..

I walked in to a tasting even here last night, and was excited to see so much chocolate, presented in such a minimalist, classy manner. The service at this event was superb, with extremely attentive staff, complimentary prosecco and a soothing hand massage using cocoa butter and cocoa nibs.\n\nI have come in here previously and bought the pistachio pralines for myself, and the eaton mess slab for my boyfriend (he's more of a white chocolate kinda guy). They were both nice, especially the pistachio pralines, though the actual chocolate was not perfect. Looking at the ingredients, there are just as many mysterious ingredients in this chocolate as there are in well known brands like cadburies, if not more! Hotel chocolat still find it acceptable however, to sell a box of chocolates for \u00a358. \n\nThe chocolates we tasted at the event were good, though I wouldn't describe them as luxurious. I particularly like the lemon one and the heart stuffed with cashew nut butter. The hot chocolate, I must admit, was a let down. I am used to thick Italian or Spanish hot chocolate, or at least hot chocolate with more of a rich kick. The hot chocolate here felt quite watery in comparison. \n\nThough I felt as though there were quite a few gimmicks which used cheap ingredients dressed in fancy packaging (reassurances to those who have more money than sense, maybe), the dark chocolate at the end was serious stuff, was made of very natural ingredients and had a very strong taste. This is the kind of stuff which is worth good money. I especially liked the dark chocolate with a touch of chili.\n\nAll in all, the service here is wonderful, the staff are extremely pleasant, but the chocolate (for the most part), I feel, has a lot of pretensions to live up to. If I really had to spend a lot of money on good chocolate, I think I would go to the chocolate tree in Bruntsfield, where the ingredients are very natural and made on the premise. If I had a really bad sugar craving, I would go to buy an unpretentious bar of good quality milk chocolate, instead of buying commercial chocolates in disguise at hotel chocolat.\n\nThat said, do try it and I especially recommend the dark chocolate.

Malvarosa keeps it succinct - but there is still a good amount of choice across meat, fish and vegetable spectrums. Patata bravas - good, smoky paprika flavour with a good kick, although could do with a bit more of a hit of the sauce on the potatoes. A warm ensalada of broad beans, artichoke and spinach was delicious (also available with meat, the Spanish vegetarian option, hur hur hur). I'm still enjoying the thought of chickpeas, spinach and sultanas - a tagine-y style tapas which I couldn't get enough of. \n\nI could go on - I'll admit, I forgot to ask my dinner date how the meat dishes were - so I can't comment on those. I was too busy enjoying mine to think of anything else. For dessert, we tucked into chocolate cake (super rich, bit too heavy for me, with a stomach already groaning from our mains) and flan (I got the last one hurrah!) - flan had a bit of an odd texture, so a little less enjoyable than I had hoped for. \n\nOverall, Malvarosa is a lovely place to spend an evening catching up with good friends.

As a lover of Tapas and Spanish food combined with an invitingly traditional looking interior, I headed in.\n\nWe were immediately greeted by two very welcoming and friendly ladies serving us. Inside, it feels just like a Spanish tapas bar (as long as you don't look out the window on to Portobello High Street) you can transport yourself straight to Granada.\n\nThe menu is great and offers a good variety of traditional Spanish tapas options as well as some more unique dishes, something I really like in a restaurant. Similarly, they have a well chosen wine listed, sourced from Spanish vineyards. The beers are the standard Estrella, Mahou and Alhambra along with a couple special editions I didn't expect to see. And well priced with my 250ml of white coming in at only \u00a34.60.\n\nTo eat I had marinated anchovies, Potaje de Garbanzos - a chickpea and vegetable stew, Ensalada de Invierno - a mix of saut\u00e9ed greens and Merluza al Chilindr\u00f3n - baked Hake with ratatouille. They were all spectacular. The anchovies were served with chopped parsley and plenty garlic - perfect! The chickpea stew was very well flavoured. It had sultanas in it and I don't usually like sweet and savoury at the same time but with a perfect balance of spices and sweetness this Moorish style dish was so nice. The mixed greens were also cooked perfectly; al dente but still with a golden char on the outside.\n\nThe Hake comes with a bit of a story. I was aware it would take a little longer as it was baked in the oven to order (great) It was the last dish to arrive after a very slight wait (only about 5 minutes longer than expected). Despite not having a problem with this at all, our servers were incredibly apologetic, took it off our bill and gave us a complimentary bowl of olives! It was definitely worth the wait. It was beautifully cooked; creamy white, flaky flesh and served with a ratatouille that was massive on flavour.\n\nI have to give a special mention to those olives as well. They are huge, I don't know what they were marinated in but as far as olives go, they were spectacular.\n\nI went through a period of eating my way through Edinburgh's Spanish restaurants and Malvarosa is certainly up there with the best. It has the whole package; great food, great staff, great atmosphere and good value.

With the cutest porcelain drawer-handles to replace the old ones on my desk drawers? And the delicious smell of vanilla candles to compliment the equally vanilla perfume on my dressing table? And a beauteous mug full of fresh lemon and ginger tea on the desk, sitting beside the completely unique and individual hand-made leather-bound notebook, containing all the notes for my latest upcoming novel. And beside the gorgeous cup and beautiful notebook, a mismatching (yet so mismatching it matches) china plate that I made using the most stunning yet still practical of kitchen utensils (like a pink spatula, floral bowl, hand-carved wooden spoon) spread with a layer of butter from the pottery butter jar.\n\nYou get the picture.

But I've put the cushion back too straight. This is not a house of straightness. As she bends to re-skew it, back to the perfect angle, just so, I notice the way her dress falls. It's elegant. It's quirky. It's colourful. Oh, for a dress like that.\n\nThe coffee table is laden with enormous books: Berlin. Photography. Seasonal Pies. Spaces... Spaces? They're beautiful, and they don't look like they've ever been opened. They are there to be on the table. The table, likewise, is there to bear their unread weight. A candle in a tin, too, wide, with three wicks, which have never been lit; a fresh, fruity aroma hovers around it all the same.\n\nI turn to comment on the beautiful smell but she's pulling on a patchwork apron over her beautiful dress. It messes up her hair a little bit, improves it somehow. \"Let's make a cake!\" she laughs - that laugh again - and pulls me out into the hall by my arm, starting to make for the kitchen. I wonder vaguely if she ought not to perhaps try making one of the Seasonal Pies instead. I nearly trip over a padded fabric doorstop on my way out, a paisley and polka-dot letter \"A\". Ah. Her name stops doors from closing. Of course.\n\n\"I'm - I'm sorry,\" I stammer, un-straightening the A, checking it for a mark where I've kicked it. No. Thank goodness. \"Actually, I - I have to be heading off again pretty soon.\" I seem in danger of knocking everything, and yet there's so much room here. Spaces.\n\n\"But you never stay!\" she cries, with a playful pout. \"I've got these pecans to use up, you know...\"\n\n\"No, really, sorry, I know, ha. Um.\" I shrug.

I love this area of the Grassmarket, Bow Street in particular, with all it's unexpected boutique stores of the arty variety, independent caf\u00e9s, bars, food shops and restaurants. And so when I saw a new jewellery store with a name I hadn't heard of, a large glass window displaying a minimalist, white-and-wood interior with dainty little pieces scattered across old tree branches, I didn't hesitate to have a nosey.\n\nThe jewellery itself is beautiful. There are different collections from local, up-and-coming designers. Some are quite simple and elegant, others are more in vogue and perhaps suited to particular tastes (geometric shapes). I can't guarantee that you'll find something you want everytime you come in but I get the feeling the display and what's for sale will change every-so-often, and the style of jewellery is not predictable. So if you need to buy a special piece, this would certainly be a good place to look.\n\nThere are silver and gold jewellery, as well as some kitschy plastic. Prices weren't cheap but by no means ghastly expensive. I saw a ring I loved for \u00a350 (but buying a ring of a heart silhouette for yourself is perhaps a little desperate?) So it remained unbought. Other pieces could be around \u00a3150.\n\nI like Black Box, a lot. It's the sort of shop I'll pop into every few weeks when I'm passing just for a look and if a particularly arty friend, who appreicates the unique one-off in-vogue pieces, has a celebration coming up, this is one of the first places I'd look for a potential gift.", "business_id": "OeNvgx7D6nJ-07whO2BHLQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-21", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "PH-TR5VxMTOmOscSeufDMw", "review_id": "x95LHLEx6CL6ss4xlQZpWg", "text": "While I am too old for Claire's (unless I'm taking my niece in), I still feel as though I'm not quite ready to be in ultra posh jewelry stores where there are guards standing outside and diamonds dripping everywhere.

It's a cafe called Butternut Squash, so making me think it would have some interesting and delicious items on the menu that would involve vegetables, but what we found was standard cafe fare. Tuna mayo or prawn marie rose on sandwich, potato or baguette? Stovies, bacon rolls, mac n cheese, pasta. I did notice later that a more extensive menu than the one we found (I think the lady serving was busy when we first turned up so had to seek a menu out ourselves). It just wasn't that interesting, and as a pescatarian, the meat-heavy menu was a struggle for me to find anything. \n\nNow, on the push to a 3 star, the baked potato was huge (albeit microwaved) and a generous portion of tuna mayo was heaped on top. Bemusingly though - butter on the side - not that I wanted it, but the surgical incision of butter between cold topping and hot potato was more than I would bother with. Seemed odd to serve it that way. Nice salad on the side though. Reasonable prices too. \n\nUltimately though, I went with a 2 star, because I felt the cafe title belied what it served.

This merits one star.   \n\nNegatives:  Pricey, info is mostly derivative, the tour is horribly rushed with NO time to spend in the beautiful display room, tasting room is poorly managed and poorly stocked; staff was rude and not well informed.\n\nDetailed Description:\nIf you MUST do this tour, do the basic tour (11 GBP) and skip the Gold tour (19GBP). If you don't know anything about scotch you might find it interesting.  If you have marginal knowledge of scotch you will find it useless.  The barrel ride is a joke and has no useful info.  \n\nWe found ourselves up at the royal mile with time to kill before a tour reservation so decided to check this out.  Initially I was against it, but then read the reviews and decided to spring for it.  My wife (not a scotch drinker) did the basic tour and I did the gold since the included 4 additional tastings seemed like a bargain; was I WRONG!\n\nBarrel tour was waste of time and insult to intelligence.\nAroma room was moderately useful and well presented; hence one star.\nThe display room of over 3300 bottles of scotch from a private collection was beautiful, but we were allowed less than 3 minutes in the room.  I could have spent much more time but was forced out into the tasting room.\nAh, the tasting room was massively disappointing.  The four additional tastings of the gold tour tastes were pre-selected; which they do NOT inform you at the beginning of the tour, nor do they tell you that the tastings are less than 1 dram.  WTF!  OK, I get that I won't be able to try high end rare scotches as part of a tour, but I wanted to try something new as I had tried two of the four scotches, but was told no.  Guests should be given a choice of scotches from a list of about a dozen for the tastings. They do have an extensive scotch menu in the tasting room, but many of them are not stocked.  In the hour we were in the tasting room over a dozen patrons wished to try scotches that were on the menu only to be told they were unavailable.  Just before we left I inquired about the lack of availability and was informed that the tour gets the dregs of what is available and the disgruntled staff member told me where in Edinburgh to go to sample a wide range of scotches. \n\nVERY DISSAPPOINTING EXPERIENCE!!", "business_id": "b2EmN9-mvKrJz52Y7IA60w", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-07-25", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}, "user_id": "5Wb9S2KRzavF19g6ATpWjA", "review_id": "cq1Y14bsPOzEQ7F-cEriug", "text": "It costs nearly \u00a312.\n\nIt isn't a proper distillery.\n\nThere's no information availabe here that you can't find by going onto Wikipedia and typing in \"whisky\".\n\nDon't be a mug.", "business_id": "b2EmN9-mvKrJz52Y7IA60w", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-07-25", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}, "user_id": "wulP0LzE_oJx_b-7J3XEhg", "review_id": "nqyeuvN8jy-MMKPMgzekGA", "text": "Cool little tasting gallery and automated tour.

I pretty much try and expect just what is stated and not more.\n\nSo anyway, my dad and I checked this place out one weekday afternoon.  We're both whisky fans and a shopkeeper suggested we check it out.  We signed on for the Silver Tour which turned out to be a good deal.\n\nIt does start out as a ride of sorts.  I didn't find it cheesy but I'm an easy going guy.  I think if I'd done this before visiting any distilleries this part would have been very informative.  As it happened, this was at the end of my trip to Scotland so I had been to just a few distilleries.  By few, I mean about 10... Ahem.  Anyway, I still found it a cool little touch to the tour.  Once you're taken through the malt's eye view of distillation, the group gathers and the actual guided part of the tour begins.\n\nIt's essentially a mini class on what constitutes a scotch whisky and an explanation of the different sources of flavor and color a whisky can have.  The approach here is that you know very little of whisky and may not even have ever tasted one.  I think for someone brand new to this drink, it would be quite helpful.  For myself, I already know what I like but I still enjoyed it. This part ends with you picking a scent/flavor note and being given a whisky from that selection.\n\nFrom here you and your chosen whisky move into the next area which is the largest collection of whisky bottles I've ever seen.  It actually was an individual's private collection which had been donated.  I don't know, I like it.  There were some really old and really interesting bottles.  I enjoyed this part as well. \n\nFrom there you move into the final area which also has a bar.  My silver tour included 4 additional tastings which were quite tasty. Don't fear, I was walking and not driving.  I walked away from my tour with a Glencairn glass and warm insides.  Definitely think it was a good value given the four additional tastings.\n\nAlso, throughout the tour (excepting the collection room) they have some theme for kids.  Just after the ride, they have a cat character on the walls meant to entertain young children.  In the final area, there are some interactive play areas with the cat as well.\n\nOne final thing I should note is that in addition to the tour, they have a downstairs gift shop, bar and restaurant.  I did have a sandwich here and it was actually good.  I wasn't expecting much but the food I had was a nice surprise.  I don't know if I'd make it a point to go there just to eat but if you're waiting for your tour to start and want a bite, you'd do well.\n\nI'd recommend this place to visitors.

A tour you can take that teaches you about whisky.\nb. A bar/tasting room you go to at the end of the tour.\nc. A gift shop where you can buy bottles of whisky and various souvenirs. \nd. A restaurant (which I did not go to). \n\nThe tour itself is a combination of interesting and cheesy. It starts off with an \"educational\" amusement park-style ride that you might find in Epcot Center. You sit in a barrel-shaped cart that goes down a track while a hologram explains the process of making whiskey to you in the language of your choice. No, I'm not making this up.\n\nFollowing that you go into a room where an actual non-holographic human being gives you scratch-and-sniff cards and teaches you about the four regions of whisky-making in Scotland. I am not making this up either. \n\nYou then get to choose which region you want to sample whiskey from (hint: if you've never had whiskey before go with Speyside or Highlands malts. They tend to be the sweetest and smoothest. Islays are the harsh peaty whiskeys) and your host pours you a small tasting glass. \n\nThe next step of the tour is the largest collection of whiskey in the world. It's an impressive collection and very well presented. I believe you can pay more to take the last tour of the day which allows you to spend more time in the collection room. I found it interesting, but didn't feel like I was missing out on anything by mainly looking at the collection as a whole, and not examining each individual bottle. \n\nFinally, the tour exits into the tasting room. If you paid for the \"silver tour\" you are now done. If you bought the \"gold tour\" you get a flight of whiskey from the tasting room. This flight is chosen by the museum and will generally consist of a lower-end whiskey from each of the four regions. Please do not ask the host to give you top-shelf 30 year malts instead. \n\nYou can also purchase glasses of whisky in the tasting room. I found if you sit at the bar and wait until the wave of people from the latest tour group have trickled out, the host will have time to talk to you and make some good recommendations based on what you've tried that you like. \n\nThe hosts were all very friendly and very knowledgeable.\n\nWhen you decide you're done there, you can go to the gift shop and buy whisky to take with you or any number of little tchochkes.\n\nI wouldn't say I learned a ton at the Scotch Whisky Experience, but I found the tour design to be fascinating (you can tell some serious money and thought went into it - even if it is hokey), the large whisky collection to be impressive and getting recommendations from the hosts to be worthwhile.

I'm not going to lie. But it was incredibly interesting to learn how whisky is made. Double distillation. Who knew? (Not me apparently!)

Neat!\n\nThen, you get to try one! I would have gone for the Islay whisky, but the Speyside whisky was Glengrant (and I've always wanted to try the whisky with my name), so I opted for that one while the other half had the Islay whisky. Both were tasty, but the Islay whisky was on the mild side, and not as delicious as Laphroig or Ardbeg! \n\nThen you get to see the amazing whisky collection. There are an insane number of bottles there. It's fascinating to see them, and there are so many you probably couldn't even look at them all during one tour!

Mit diesem Fa\u00df f\u00e4hrt man durch eine virtuelle Destillerie, um den Herstellungsprozess eines Single Malts erkl\u00e4rt zu bekommen. Nach einer ca. 10 min\u00fctigen Fahrt empf\u00e4ngt der \"Tourguide\" die Teilnehmer in einem kleinen Raum, in der die Herstellung nochmal mithilfe von Gerste und Torf auch sensorisch gezeigt. Dann wurde auch die Bedeutung der Pot Stills und der F\u00e4sser erkl\u00e4rt.\n\nDanach kam es zum Wichtigsten Teil des Abends: das Tasting. In diesem Raum haben uns bereits gef\u00fcllte Nosing Gl\u00e4ser auf farbig markierten Punkten erwartet, daneben eine Karte mit den selben Farben, die mit den Regionen Speyside, Lowlands, Highlands und Islay beschriftet waren. Wir sollten dann unsere Nasen \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen und an den farbigen Teilen der Karten rubbeln und riechen, um den \"regionentypischen\" Geruch erfahren zu k\u00f6nnen. 2 Whiskies gab es dann zu probieren, aus den Highlands den Deanston und von Islay den Ardbeg. Dazu wurde uns der richtige Ablauf eines Tastings erkl\u00e4rt - sehen, riechen, schmecken.\n\nNach dem Tasting ging es weiter in die weltgr\u00f6\u00dfte Whiskysammlung, dort erwartete uns schon wieder ein Dram :) Die Whiskysammlung von Claive Vidiz umfasst um die 3500 Einzelflaschen Whisky.

As apparently the face I pulled on first taste of my Hanger Steak said far more than any number of words could. It ended with a raised eyebrow and an audible sigh. That good.\n\nBut let's (be kind) rewind a little. I've been to two other Jamie's Italians (Glasgow and Reading) and loved both. So it was with a lot of anticipation, excitement and glee that I visited Jamie's Italian Edinburgh on a Sunday evening. THis can be a dangerous this, as expectation can lead to disappointment. Luckily, not this evening, not this restaurant, not this steak.\n\nI came with a group of 9, and given the sheer size of the venue this was not a problem at all. Groups as large as 20 could be seated here and not look out of place, or prove even a distraction. The venue is the newly refurb'd Assembly Rooms and oh my. How lush, lavish and positively sumptuous are the surroundings? All tall ceilings, beautiful cornicing, chandeliers, red and white and warmth, with three separate rooms (one that could have been a ballroom I swear). Just...again it leaves me speechless. The ambiance lends itself well to either large groups, families or even date nights (something I wouldn't say of the Glasgow or Reading Jamie's.)\n\nA wee aside, but kudos for the music! Michael Jackson, Cindy Lauper, \"Love is in the Air'. The sort of music that had us all bopping in our seats (although it is a little loud, which I know some people don't appreciate).\n\nSo, to the food. Don't prepare to do anything strenuous after eating here. If you come and all you order is some light fish or the salad, shame on you. Ok you don't necesarily have to order *two* starters and the largest steak on the menu, as I did, but still - come here to feast! It's too good not to.\n\nI had the fish plank, to share, and also the squid as a starter. The squid delicious, in crisp batter, with a nice mix of rings and the wee legs. Yum. The fish board, oh yes. I can't even remember everything that came with it, but battered white bait, whole sardines and more squid; smocked mackerel pate; shellfish; smoked salmon; pecorino cheese; carrot and olive salad. There was probably more. After that I could have been well satisfied, it was delicious and great fun as a dish presented on a huge plank rested on two cans of Italian tomatoes.\n\nJust as well I made sensible light choices for my starter (hahahaha) as I'd pipped for the Hanger Steak for 2 (yes, I shared it with someone!) as my main. Considering it was \u00a330 between two, and it came with polenta chips, it was actually really good value at \u00a315 each. And oh sweet baby jesus. That steak. Now we've come full circle to the beginning of my review. I had to take a moment, literally, after my first mouthful. All manner of good things were happening inside my mouth. It was medium-rare, it was grilled and smoky and charcoaly, it was a beautiful cut (apart from one piece of gristle) and it was just perfect. The polenta chips it came with were also great.\n\nEverything that everyone had at our table of 9 had praise piled onto it, was finished without a word of complaint. All of it - divine. Jamie's Italian might be a chain, but it's a chain with independent style and a definite attention to detail and quality. \n\nDespite that I'd been to two other Jamie's Italians, my experience here was different enough to the noteworthy. Partly due to the wonderfully lavish Assembly Room venue, partly due to the slightly different menu (The Hanger Steak for example) and largely due to the fabulous company.\n\nSunday nights are my favourite. Jamie's Italian was the perfect choice for that given Sunday night. I will most definitely be back, and this time with the aim of having starter, main AND dessert.", "business_id": "KvIVxlyFoOtSRuLeAjblXg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-07-23", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}, "user_id": "sPqx6MSgG006SQVHxtL2gA", "review_id": "2FqMHx7UtzlVxGxKE5n_GA", "text": "Had the rare opportunity to abandon the kids for the evening and go and have a night out with the other half.

I think I made my way through half the cocktail list at the bar in the wait for our table, we also ordered 2 appetisers, during our wait at the bar.  The cheesy nachos dish was beautiful and then we ordered bread and oils, this wasn't so good, the bread was dry and required more oil, would have been nice to have a separate dish of oil for dipping.  The bread comes in a fancy small dish, 3 of our breads fell out on the floor, the waitress picked them up and walked away, and to be honest we were that starving from our wait I would have ate them off the floor.  I do think that we should have been given more bread, as the dish the bread is delivered in is not suitable for when waiting in the bar area.  But that is me being very picky.  We did get our table bang on the full 1hr45min wait.  Food arrived promptly that we ordered, I had the pasta arribbatta dish, was very hot and spicy, just the way I love it, my partner had the lamb, he said it was good but he has had better lamb kebabs ( I think that meant it was ok, but not amazing).

I wasn't sure how popular this place is and whether we should book a table or not (since it's 'only' lunch time) and we decided to chance it. A table was indeed available when we arrived.\n\nUpon entering the restaurant, I saw big chandeliers and red walls - for some reason I had expected a more modern look but at least it made an effect on me :)\nIn the downstairs dining area there is a big italian bar 'island' with large parma hams hanging from above. Like Karen D. noted, probably not the best place to be seated if you are a vegetarian (I'm not though) and we had a table close by.\n\nThe waiter appeared very quickly and took our drinks order and explained the daily specials. I chose the slow cooked lamb ravioli with a sauce of sundried tomatoes and peas - it sounded wonderful.

I guess the ravioli edges were thicker and thus needed more cooking time. \nI explained this to the waiter who promised to rectify the situation.

Is this still in Edinburgh and if so why doesn't the rest of Edinburgh look like this? (Why doesn't my kitchen look like this) - Yes I am impressed with the interior from the mezzanine to the indoor market feel of the chartecurie Island 'bar' in the middle. Once seated we were promptly helped by a waiter-in-training. He was nervous but incredibly friendly and helpful. (possibly the watchful eyes of his mentor played part in this but it felt very genuine). \n\nI was here with Anita A. (she reviewed this earlier) My experience was slightly different than hers. I too noticed the big shapy chandeliers and I think they fit. As mentioned the service is high standard, as we had a trainee waiter we'll overlook some of the mistakes that he made.  \nMy Rabbit Taglioni was delicious, well cooked and well seasoned. \nAnita's slow cooked lamb ravioli (a special) was al dente, however the pasta (all daily home made and fresh btw) was a big thick on the edges thus in our opinion deserved some longer cooking time. This was mentioned and promptly the dish was returned to the kitchen and chef made a new dish with 12 min cooked ravioli instead of 8. When delivered back to the table, they ensured that every care was taken to make this dish perfect... but he forgot to supply Anita with some fresh cutlery as they took the former set away to the kitchen, thus she had to nick from the table behind her. \nThese extra 4 minutes made not much difference to the thickness of the ravioli edges, nor was it notably softer. Anita left these on her plate. The sauce and filling were delicious though. \n\nThe limoncello jello dessert was meh. It didn't feel there was much effort was put in to this. The FroYo was good though.\n\nIn all this place is very good, but somehow it needs a bit more work.  I expected more from this.

Sadly, this experience turned out to be one of the worst dining experiences of my life! \n\nThey give you a pager that you can't leave the restaurant with, which is understandable given that the pager range may be limited. However, when I asked if we could put our name down and come back in about an hour to pick up our pager (which a lot of restaurants do, especially Cheesecake Factory given their popularity), considering the wait time we were quoted was 1.5 to 2 hours, we were told no, that we had to wait in the small bar area that had no seating area and was already overcrowded.\n\nWhile standing and waiting in the small bar area we decided we would seat ourselves at the bar in the middle of the restaurant. There were six open stools and we sat in four of the empty stools. Where we sat there was only a bar menu. We thought that we could at least order some appetizers at this bar, however, a waitress quickly chased us out of that area and said that we couldn't sit there because they were planning to seat people for dinner there. What a joke! The whole 2+ hours we were there, they never sat anyone there! \n\nWhen we were finally seated after what felt like an eternity, we were seated in the back of the restaurant by the kitchen. Waiters butts were right there. It felt like it was over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. It was so hot and uncomfortable sitting in that area that I had to go outside to cool down. All you felt sitting in this section right by the open kitchen was just heat radiating at you from the ovens, it was as if I was sitting in an oven while trying to eat my meal. After moving our table, the food arrived.\n\nNow I realize we weren't in Italy; however, you'd think eating at a restaurant that has a well-known chef as its owner who has cooking shows and criticizes what people eat in America, that you'd be able to get a decent meal. Not the case at Jamie Oliver's where the pasta was horrible and there was no complimentary bread.

Where most almond croissants are almond paste basted in the heart of a pastry fold, and carry the body of a normal looking croissant, The Wee Boulangerie was like a Picasso impression, with crispy almond sponge oozing out everywhere. It didn't even really look like a croissant. But it tasted light, not dry, not too sweet, and the crispy light edges made a delightful contrast to the heaviness of the croissant itself. I enjoyed every, single, mouthful. \n\nA note as well - I'm on a diet. Almond croissants are pretty much verboten. The SR is on a diet. He is sick with jealousy at my hedonism...

I passed this place in late August and as far as I noticed it was still the former old-man pub and when I next saw it in early September it was The Blackbird. Interested, a group of 5 of us went along, I think it was perhaps the 2nd or 3rd night of business and it was reassuringly busy.\n\nA mixture of folk but the prevailing demographic was well-heeled 30-somethings. It seemed busy as people tended to cluster near the door but further back in this narrow but long-ish pub there was space to be found. I ordered my drink but waited, genuinely, 5 minutes for it to arrive. Initially being the only lad in our group the barman, disguising it as beer advice, spent the ensuing time chatting up my mates. I thought he'd forgotten all about me and was about to re-order from his colleauge when he began to pour it. OK. Nice pint, not much change from a fiver.\n\nThe decor is OK. It is fresh and it is trendy but it all seemed pretty dark. Colour and lighting. Maybe that's trendy too though. Soon, a couple more joined our party and orders were taken from the table by a waitress, just for two pints. Over a ten minute period the drinks were chased up twice. A very polite girl came round 4 times for empties before the fullies eventually arrived with apologies. I could probably have turned up with 20 supermodels and been served quicker at the bar.\n\nThis place is potentially cool, and given the benefit of the doubt the drinks fiasco was probably teething problems.\n\nOn the up-side Blackbird has several London-brewed beers (on tap as well as bottled), so you can just pretend you're in London when you get silver back from your \u00a35 and have a lovely night looking at the pretty girls and boys.\n\nWe enjoyed the night, but we haven't been back yet.", "business_id": "95RAoc1wnt2rs28Wfs6_1Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-10-03", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 3, "useful": 3, "cool": 2}, "user_id": "gV5MYRAb3ooZnJAUaKZpIA", "review_id": "jn539ETst0kNKXaSVXI5kA", "text": "First sign that things had changed was the missing mobility scooter that was for ever parked outside the old place.

I didn't eat, but the food looked pretty good....burgers actually looked exceptional. \n\nThe only trouble for me is the position. I'm Bruntsfield based but if I'm going for a pint I'm more inclined to choose a place off the main routes into town.

I can see, reading other's reviews, that it isn't a one-size-fits-all kinda place. Maybe even a bit like Marmite, to reference the over-used analogy. I like cocktails. I like good food, but without pretence. So the 5 page cocktail menu and gastropub food menu that included both burgers, as well as half chicken with lemon and oregano, and a venison steak with haggis fritters, is exactly what I want in a local gastro-cocktail-bar.\n\nI mean, we are going to have to broaden our vocab from \"pub\", \"bar' and \"gastropub\". As The Blackbird is kind of both a bar, and a gastropub. It's a gastrobar? There, I've coined a new one - gastrobar.\n\nWhen I heard Treacle were opening a new bar in Old Town (my neighbourhood) I probably let out a real squeal of joy. I adore Treacle (I think I've written a gazillion updates to my original review of it). It's a bar where you can get good cocktails and good pub food. And so it seems The Blackbird is the same.\n\nTreacle, Hamilton's of Stockbridge and The Blackbird. All part of the same family. And The Blackbird is like a love child of the two, edging more towards Hamilton's. The food menu is the same, with a slightly higher standard of choices (and higher prices). Hence the venison steak - which is what I ordered.\n\nIf I'm really going to compare, the venison steak that I had in Hamilton's of Stockbridge (a near identical dish) was better. The steak was slightly over-cooked at The Blackbird, and the haggis fritters were more fritter than haggis. But saying that, it was still really good and I ate it all. They perhaps just need to settle into themselves to match up to their big brother bar.\n\nThe cocktail menu is huge, and my Dark n' Stormy was perfect - and served in a tall glass!\n\nThe decor is so, just, mmm yes. Dark, candles, a mismatch of couches, booths, tables. It was really busy on a Thursday night (all seats were gone) and the bar got crowded. There's not much room around the bar so this proved a problem. But all the staff were really friendly - they were happy to accommodate my request of a table for 6 and then didn't say anything when only 3 took the large booth. So whilst I can imagine it's popularity will make it hard to get a seat, I just suggest you book in advance and don't mind the hustle and bustle.\n\nI can see myself coming back here a lot.

Cow-fray-ya? Chow-nom-om-nom?\n\nHowever you pronounce the name of this Thai restaurant, it's probably a solid bet for a nice Thai meal, bordering on feast, in opulent surroundings with the best of service.\n\nSituated on the fourth floor of an innocuous doorway on Castle Street, it has taken over the space Olorosso occupied. Boasting views of the Castle, we sadly didn't get to see these as they had a plastic-canopied balcony set-up, and the plastic windows of the canopy obscured the view. A bit of a shame, but the attention to detail of the interior made up for it. It reminded me of dining in New York. Not one fork, tile or fish has been scrimped on. There is a giant fish tank in the middle of the restaurant with a variety of tropical fish. There are unusual, Eastern-inspired lighting, all subdued giving a warm, low-lit glow. There are statues of traditional Thai buddhas. There are many very friendly Thai waitresses greeting you with the traditional Thai greeting. \n\nIt very much reminded me of the hotel restaurant I dined in several times when I went to Thailand a few years ago. 5 star Thai service, no doubt about it.\n\nThe menu is quite large with something for everyone. Thai curries and food can often be very, very spicy (those darned bird's eye chilles). But I think they had toned this down for our Western palates.\n\nThe sharing Asian platter, at \u00a39.90 per person, for a starter looked very tempting but we agreed would ahve filled us before our mains. So the starters of dumplings and fish cakes between 3 were a nice alternative. If I'm honest, the dumpling filling was a little overcooked and dry, and the fish cakes were just a bit weird. They had the texture of spam, like ground and reformulated fish. But were delicious in their own way. \n\nThe lamb massamam curry as a main was deliciously fragrant, sweet and creamy. The lamb was, again, a little dry and over cooked but it all disappeared and was a nice dish. My stir fry ginger king prawns was probably my favourite dish. Light, lots of vegetables, at least 7 large king prawns. Given that another Thai restaurant I visited presented me with my main King Prawn dish with only 4 prawns, this was a plus for me.\n\nMy sister had the Fisherman's Soup which came presented in the traditional Thai way (from what I had experienced in China) in it's own bubbling pot, served over a candle to keep it hot. A very fragrant lemongrass broth, with a great spice that hit the back of your throat, and a mix of sea food including the biggest mussell I've ever seen. This was also impressive.\n\nIf you're full after all that, the flowering jasmine tea is a great, elaborate and beautiful digestif for the end of the evening. The Irish Coffees were sadly not so great. But as my sister commented, you can't really fault a Thai restaurant for not doing Irish coffees too well?! Flowering Jasmine tea trumps, I'd say.\n\nIs it the best Thai food I've had in Edinburgh? No. Was it one of the most luxurious, enjoyable, well-cared for meals I've had, with a rather lovely serving of food? Well, yes.\n\nI would absolutely come back to Chaoo..... this restaurant for the opulent surroundings, the ambiance, atmosphere and outstanding service. It is a place to impress, whether it's your date, your parents, a business partner or meeting. It will absolutely provide the perfect setting for any special occasion, and you won't have to worry about the service not being on par. The food is definitely good, and we all finished our meals.

If you can get a table in the glass box at the back, you're treated to a panoramic view of Edinburgh, from the castle to the Pentlands to the Forth. Magnificent, and surely one of the best views in town.\n\nEven if you can't get the view, the d\u00e9cor and style of the place is very nice, with statues, fish tank and generally upmarket feel. In fact, as you walk up the stairs and enter the main dining room, it feels like you've misread the menu and this isn't the place you'd planned to pop into for a \u00a36.95 plate of pad thai at lunch.\n\nThe service is very attentive, if not in fact too obsequious for comfort. I know it's a Thai culture thing, but I don't really like being waited on by Uriah Heep. Most 'umble, most 'umble.\n\nIn keeping with the upmarket style of the interior, the presentation of the food is beautiful. Especially with mixed starters, everything is arranged handsomely on the serving dishes, supplemented with stylish cutlery and place settings and even the menu design.\n\nSo overall, it's a stylish establishment with a view to die for and inexpensive lunch prices. Sad to say, in the end, the food didn't live up to the surroundings. We've been twice now, and both times the food was pleasant enough, but lacking in zing and certainly lacking in spice. The curry had no chilli whatsoever, and was made with strange large smooth slices of chicken breast that resembled thick chicken loaf. My pad thai was lacking in any citrus or tamarind tang, and didn't come with a wedge of lime to spritz over the top, which was sorely needed in this case.\n\nIt was all ok, but so westernised as to be bland.\n\nGiving it 4 stars because if you're looking to have a stylish lunch with a grand view, then this is a good bet.

Edinburgh has literally hundreds of options, and my current 'Edinburgh hit list' is aimed at evening meals. My friend happened to mention my review of Chaophraya and how she wished we could try that. I suddenly realised that I'd read on their Twitter that they'd recently opened their newest addition to the chain in the 'Burgh. Lo and behold, it was literally round the corner from where we were!\n\nMaybe we are just a bit dim-witted (this is pretty likely...) but we had an adventure getting there. The first issue was totally our fault: we walked right past it. We saw the sign in the foyer and decided to take the stairs instead of the lift. So we headed up the stairs...and found ourselves lost in an upper floor full of locked doors and fire escapes. The key to success: be lazy and use the lift. The stairs are not for Chaophraya!\n\nAfter the ridiculous journey, we decided a wee cocktail was ideal. The cocktail menu seemed similar to the Glasgow branch but the Siam Smile cocktail wasn't described properly.\n\nWe opted for the lunch menu and had a single course each - we were dipping in and out of Edinburgh's finest cocktail bars and patisseries all day so we didn't want to overfill ourselves! Splendid.\n\nMy main dish consisted of gorgeous, fat udon noodles stir fried with fresh seafood (scallops, mussels, calamari, tiger prawns), and flavoured with garlic, chunky chillies, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, fine beans, onion & sweet basil. It's pretty spicy, but not a patch on the spicy beast I devoured last time I was in Chaophraya! It was delicious. Everything Thai noodles should be!\n\nMy friend had a really nice creamy and nutty lamb curry. The strips of lamb had been slowly cooked in coconut milk with cashew nuts, potato & Spanish onion so everything was soft and moist, but also absolutely saturated with gorgeous flavours. It was served with sticky jasmine rice - every bite was a pleasure. It was just a lovely, warming, comforting (and filling) Thai curry.\n\nMy other friend had the Thai green curry. At first it tastes very mild and sweet, then the fiery chillies kick in. It was fantastic. The chicken is marinated with lemon grass, coriander & garlic and then grill cooked. The chicken is added to the green curry sauce, avocado, fine beans, sweet basil, red chilli & sticky jasmine rice. It was really tasty and not too heavy to eat. Just beautiful.\n\nThe staff were friendly, the restaurant is absolutely gorgeous - the same Chaophraya style but with this beautiful rooftop edge - and I had a lovely dining experience here.

Yes, there are many places that do breakfast and brunch all-day at the weekend, or have a modest breakfast menu running every day. But the Blue Bear has opened it's fuzzy arms wide and is giving the biggest, tasty bear hug to lovers of pancakes, waffles, french toast, omelettes, scrambled eggs, eggs benny, granola, porridge, cereal, even just a serving of crunchy toast.\n\nI mean, the breakfast menu is huuugeeee. I have the memory of a goldfish, so took a photo of it and tried to upload it to the Yelp biz listing (take a look). But from my Dori-like memory (\"just keep swi-mming!\") there was the Big Bear breakfast (with veggie option), a whole 8 different egg options (including 4 types of omelette, from feta and olives to chorizo and pepper), eggs benny and royale, scrambled eggs, even 'Humpty Dumpty' for the kids (a boiled egg); there was graonla, yoghurt, different types of cereal and porridge; there was french toast with three different topping options (berries, creme fraiche, bacon and maple syrup) and also waffles, and pancake stacks; oh my there were other things too. \n\nAnd that's not including the lunch options that include AMAZING looking stovies, delicious soups and sandwiches, and the wee bites menu also has calamari and lamb meatballs. Phew. \n\nOh, and they also do afternoon tea. Just because, y'know, all-day breakfasts till 7pm might not be enough.\n\nMy only wee concern is they might be taking on too much. Calamari and lamb meatballs (and roasted veg etc.) all sound delicious (oh and mezze platters) and are also to my taste, but are quite different to waffles and pancakes and egg-breakfasts. I really wouldn't want it to be a case of spreading themselves too thin over different options.\n\nBut from what I could tell, the stovies to my right, the soup my dining partner was having, and the eggs benny I had were all very well done.\n\nI visited on opening day and it was busy. They had run out of stovies by 12.30 (a good sign!). You could tell it was a new caf\u00e9 - the service was at times a little muddle, and I heard another table comment (kindly) it was a bit slow, but I'm sure given a bit more time it'll be tip top.\n\nThey obviously have high ambitions and standards, and if they can pull off the full breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea and cake menu I'll take my hat off to them. So far, from what I can see, it looks very good.\n\nThey also have art exhibited on the walls by 4 different local artists. I love touches like that. And I believe they may be serving alcohol soon too.\n\nSo if it's Tuesday morning and you want pancakes, go to Blue Bear. If it's Thursday at 6pm and you want graonla or eggs benny, go here. If it's Sunday at 3pm and you slept in too late and missed brunch elsewhere - well, Blue Bear are still serving.\n\nI will definitely be back to try the pancakes, and waffles, oh and the afternoon tea.", "business_id": "qy8EKF7IXGe65_wglj4AgQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-01-28", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 3, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "A9-glR1fyftwhhOD-RwlYw", "review_id": "fqt7iV9ikpDOm7kYfLtSqw", "text": "I loved Moo Cafeteria and was sad to see it go.

As we were a group of 11, we had pre-booked and also decided to pre-order to save time. We were sat at a big table right at the back and my first impressions were that I like the decor and art on the walls. Second highlight was the complimentary vege crisps that were in a couple of bowls on the table.  They were absolutely delicious!  After eating at least half of one of the bowlfuls, I was then regretting that I had ordered more crisps in the form of vegetarian nachos.  I'm not vegetarian, but had eaten spaghetti bolognese the night before, so didn't feel like more mince.  Therefore I was surprised when my meal came and it looked like normal beef mince nachos.  I assume it was Quorn mince?  I was expecting just to get a bean/salsa mix.  It was nice, just not what I expected.  Came with a bit of guacamole and a what was described as a salsa sauce, but tasted like sweet chilli to me - was quite spicy.  I was extremely full after finishing.\n\nAs the Blue Bear have an extensive all day breakfast menu, a couple of my colleagues got the waffles with bacon and maple syrup.  In comparison to our nachos, these were quite small dishes.  One guy was disappointed by the small helping of bacon and was not sold on the savoury and sweet combo.\n\nSome of the dishes that I saw being served to other diners looked great, so I'm tempted to go back again to try them out, especially seeing as it's right by my work.\n\nIt is quite a small venue and other diners were mainly workers on their lunch break, but there was also a mother and child and an older couple.", "business_id": "qy8EKF7IXGe65_wglj4AgQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-03-31", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 4, "cool": 2}, "user_id": "uG_WIJ3fbn58rR3imVLifg", "review_id": "fqQ1f2ZtLLhKNnJgKhKuWQ", "text": "I came here to enjoy a brunch that I won as a prize during a Yelp event.\nI had already had the chance to meet the owners and be impressed by their dedication and the philosophy behind their work: they put great care not only in providing the best food possible, but also in delivering the service in a friendly and enthusiastic way.

We picked the right day, it was incredibly sunny, and walking to our prize was a real pleasure. \n\nWe got a booking at 11am. I called in advance the day before to check whether they could cater for my gluten intolerance. The answer: \"of course!\" We got the best seats, those right next to the window. Great for people watching... Unfortunately no people walked past as everyone was probably in the park! The staff on hand weren't Ben and Jemma who we met at the Yelp event, but they were equally friendly and attentive! We were told we could order anything from the menu... Difficult, considering how many things there are on offer: French toast, pancakes, waffles, granola, fruit, yogurt, English muffins, cereal, pastries... And so much more! Everything you could possibly want for breakfast!\n\nAfter taking a long look at the menu, we both decided to get the veggie breakfast. This was quite a novelty for me, as I have never had brunch, and don't usually go for British flavours. For Robbie this consisted of: Eggs (he had the choice to have them fried, poached or scrambled, he picked the latter), two veggie sausages, a potato scone, a piece of chunky (homemade-looking) toast, two grilled portobello mushrooms, 6 grilled tomatoes (still on the vine!), a veggie haggis, baked beans, a tea and an apple juice. I had the same, minus the apple juice, tea, bread, potato scone and haggis, add two slices of gluten free toast, an illy cappuccino and an orange juice. There were plenty of sauces available, I went for HP, Robbie went for butter and mayonnaise. \n\nWhen the food arrived I thought \"I can do this, no problem!\" As we began eating, we started feeling bad for having overestimated our abilities to chomp through this much food. I had a better advantage being without the potato scone and the notoriously heavy veggie haggis. Everything was cooked very well and in a healthy manner in comparison to some greasier joints in town. It was nice to not see so much oil on my plate! The sausages were delicious, I loved how the tomatoes came still on the vine, and the portobello mushrooms were also very good. I would like to know which gluten free bread they use, as I actually couldn't tell the difference between it and some gluten containing brands. There are plenty of seeds and it feels less sweet and more fiber-some than most. Giving myself a pause from eating, I took a walk around the cafe and checked out the Yelper art work, it really is on the wall! Eventually I was defeated by the eggs and half of the very generous serving of cappuccino, but managed everything else. Robbie, the winner, managed to eat everything. It did count as breakfast and lunch though... It's okay, we walked it off afterwards. Being such a beautiful day we decided to spend a couple of hours in the nearby Botanic garden.\n\nHaving been here twice now, rest assured the blue bear is consistently good. We will definitely be coming back here to try out some other offerings from the menu, perhaps a good place to take some relatives or friends when they visit? I seriously love the way yelp introduces me to things I wouldn't usually try. If you fancy a very well prepared, relatively healthy breakfast/brunch, do try out the blue bear.

The Blue Bear is officially now my favourite breakfast and brunch place in Edinburgh. There is stiff competition out there, but coming to the Blue Bear is an all-around fantastic experience.\n\nLet's start with the food. I love breakfast and, particularly, waffles and pancakes since I not only love the taste (including the great syrups, fruit or bacon you can add) but I also have fond memories of my Dad making waffles for us on weekend mornings. The Blue Bear is a fantastic locals' place and a family place that is buzzing with activity and diners eagerly awaiting their delicious meals or baked goods or coffees. I had the waffles with berry compote and my merry brunch companions had the full breakfast and eggs benedict. The full breakfast was absolutely huge, but it was perfectly done with delicious black pudding and sausage but also succulent, cooked tomatoes still on the vine. The eggs benedict looked great but was a bit overshadowed by the full breakfast calling my attention on the other side of me, and by my beautiful waffles that called 'eat me!' The waffles were gorgeous and I could go on and on about the berry compote! It was delicious and I have to say I worked hard to restrain myself from licking the plate clean.\n\nBesides the fabulous food, the Blue Bear has a great ambiance to it. The couple who owns the place are really sweet and extremely dedicated to the Blue Bear. They work hard to make sure every customer enjoys their experience and the food. I also loved how they work with local artists to display beautiful artwork that is for sale, as well as featuring some invaluable artwork by fellow Yelpers!

It's disappointing that they don't have pancakes on the menu (or not that I've seen) as I'm much more partial to a pancake than a waffle.

She wanted waffles, but not a full portion, maple syrup and bananas please. Our waiter was kind enough to charge us a half portion of waffles and sort out the bananas for us.

This place caters for vegans, coeliacs, and people with wheat and lactose intolerance. \n\nIt's quite tucked away, it would be quite easy to miss it if you didn't look for the signs to 'shining light', a centre which offers yoga, tarot readings etc. The corridor downstairs gives no indication about the quality of the food upstairs; up a flight of stairs, beyond shining light is a great spacious room with a stage, chill-out music and an aesthetically pleasing layout of very modern and stylish furniture, with a variety of high chairs and comfy low chairs.

Jess, a friendly waitress (who happens to go to my uni) came and brought us the menu. Before booking the table, I had spoken to Claire online about a particularly memorable meal I had in NY a few years ago: raw ravioli and pecan pie. She told me they'd be happy to try out any new recipe, so custom made a serving just for us! Though not quite the same as the meal I had in NY, this dish was delicious in its own right: Courgette pasta enclosing a walnut cheese filling, accompanied by fresh pesto and sundried tomato sauce, and a massive salad. My boyfriend and I shared this, then shared a Thai green curry with cauliflower 'rice', which was also delicious, with lots of flavours and interesting textures. For pudding we both ordered the pecan pie with coconut ice cream. I would love to have a high power food processor so I could make this at home-it was truly outstanding. I think the crust was made of ground down cashew nuts and agave syrup, whilst the filling was rich and the taste of pecans was very evident. The coconut ice cream was the perfect balance to the richness of the pie. Though I'm not about to become a raw food vegan, I truly believe that raw food puddings are much nicer than cooked ones. If you make a pecan pie, usually the eggs, flour and butter distract from the taste of the pecans. With a raw pudding, you have strong flavours and massive sugar hits.

I wasn't too keen on Guilty Lilly, the previous occupant of this building that closed down some time ago, but The Bonnington achieves an entirely new level of grim. \n\nIt can't quite make up its mind whether it wants to be a nice old man pub (which would probably suit the hard core of guys who have stuck with it through its numerous changes in ownership) or something a bit more quirky. As a result, The Bonnington has precisely zero character and all the charm of a corn plaster in a swimming pool.\n\nThe selection of drinks is decent and, to be completely fair, the two times I've been in the draught beers seemed fine.\n\nThe food, however, is a different story. I completely understand that since the smoking ban, pubs really need to serve food to entice people in. But honestly, if you're not going to commit to it, just stick to burger and chips. If, however, your menu promises a spiced vegetable grill in a soft white roll, I don't really expect a few chunks of almost raw pumpkin (or squash, or something) in a stale bap, which is what I got.\n\nIn short, if you're in the neighbourhood, it's well worth walking a bit further to Cannonmills, Newhaven or Leith.", "business_id": "8D33vGfjIOYBFfMzkFSxzw", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-04-30", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 6, "cool": 2}, "user_id": "uq9tCNnMJxM4QNrbUC2tfQ", "review_id": "4bRgnq8QeCZO0aTgeA6yeA", "text": "We've just moved to the area and this is our new local!

It isn't trying to be some fancy bar or serve Michelin star food. It serves good priced traditional pub food with a well stocked reasonably priced selection of beverages.\n\nThey are often showing the football on their TVs but the sound is only on in the top section of the bar, so if football isn't your thing then you can sit down in the bottom section.\n\nThe decor is nice and cosy, the staff are really friendly, they have live music on Saturday nights and a pub quiz on a Sunday. For those who have a dog, it is also dog friendly. \n\nSo far I have tried the wine (the house red and white are both pleasant and very cheap), the chilli nachos (very tasty) and the steak and Guinness pie which was delicious with a fluffy puff pastry lid.\n\nWhat more could you ask for from a local pub?", "business_id": "8D33vGfjIOYBFfMzkFSxzw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-05-13", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 2, "cool": 3}, "user_id": "omwu8Lq0Ynp2ZyhnDHQ38g", "review_id": "jGO7yPHTKdzeYGTfwSLN7g", "text": "Having just moved into the area, the Bonnington is the nearest option for:\n\nA) JD\nB) Pub grub\nC) Live football\n\nNo brainer really.\n\nJoking aside, this place has recently had a sports bar makeover from it's previous incarnation as the Guilty Lily, which if I'm honest, I wasn't a massive fan of after my one visit. The Bonnington has taken up the mantle and delivers a completely satisfactory bar room experience.\n\nAt first impressions I thought the food would be overpriced drivel, I thought  the older regulars who are still hanging on to the boozer from past guises would be rowdy and unwelcoming of any newcomers, and I thought the staff would be seasoned - no, jaded - pros who only have time for their loyal faithful.\n\nNot so on all counts.\n\nThe food is reasonably priced and decent. Their soup, sandwich and pies change daily (perhaps weekly in the case of the pie - Steak and Guiness both times we visited last week), and, although I wasn't immediately impressed by the sight of the burger - felt the bun was a bit too dominating compared to the meat - it delivered a big surprise in both moisture and flavour.\n\nThe rowdy regulars aren't rowdy at all, gathering at 'their end' of the bar under one of the many tellies, and completely minding their own business. They even add a source of entertainment after they get a little tipsy and banter starts to flow. On top of that the rest of the client base seems to be a massive mixed bag of students, working professionals, blind-daters and families in for a spot of lunch/dinner (linner?).\n\nThe staff are the icing on the cake, friendly and charming with a natural, un-forced way of making you feel like a local. Not overly attentive but in now way neglectful. A perfect balance, devoid of pretention or attitude.\n\nOf course there are negs. I have two, both with the menu, which I think could be a touch more creative. I love the standard pub fare, but as a local now, I could work my way through it and grow bored quite quickly. Perhaps a leaf out of the Roseleaf's book would help. Also, I really want to see some mash on there somewhere. The pies are outstanding and the handcut chips great... but I like my pies with mash and gravy.\n\nAll in all a great place to make a new neighbour feel welcome.

Not only are you saving the environment but you get to drink beer while doing it. Seems pretty legit in my book.

Theres also a small variety of ciders if thats what your hankering for.  You have a 1LT size bottle and upwards to 3LT I believe. As Alex J. has mentioned already you pay a deposit for the glass and then pay for your beer and they fill it up for you. I believe the beers rotate so sample away and then decide what you want. There are loyalty cards to that will go towards your next purchase when you fill it out. \n\nThis place can be busy from what I could gather while I was there. The owner is a nice gentleman who will happily chat with you and fetch whatever samples you would like to try.

Hats off, ( I think his name Terry), made eye  contact and indicated he'd come to me. Sincerely that is all I was asking. 3 staff (one I found out to be a supervisor, who bless,  looked run of his feet trying to tidy up the place!) yet still not a one came over. \n\nTall chap saved my experience. And then I saw him doing as I would do. Wine cooler filled with boiled water and polishing the silver. In this time of not scanning all the tables to see if folk needed anything the staff stood around!!  If in doubt polish!  I've work at at 5 star restaurants..... \n\nRegardless ...... Treat everyone like the Dali Lama. It is how I was trained. I'm am annoyed and angry as the furniture and opulence of Blue Goose promises different. \n\nPub has seats. Is it table service. (I personally do not like to go to the bar).  I dare say I think you staff are lazy. Check in. Check in.  Really. If folk want just a drink they'll say and go up to the bar. Each time I've every come ,I sit for food. I realise staff are not mind readers ...... They must approach. Do Not Assume.  So many opportunities to expand a customer's bill were missed. Countless missed to expand mine. \n\nCome and ask....  \" is everything ok\"......after placing god down pause, \" is there anything else I can get you?\". Address the nature table.  Thank goodness for the tall chap; I learned from him the that the General Manager is Ross.   Ross please have more training days.... Invest or you may lose large paying customers like myself.  \n\nRight, I've gone on enough!  The lemon sole tonight was magnificent,?(really),on its own but enhanced by good waiter service.

I'd heard great things about the cocktails at this new pad but that wasn't a massive pull for me. But fondue - well, that's another matter entirely.\n\nHopping up the first flight of stairs just inside the Royal British Hotel, we arrived at the trendy and swish bar to be greeted by a cheery staff member. Plush purple sofa-benches, flowers in pink water on the tables, space-age egg-chairs, and cool textured wallpaper make Juniper a cool and sophisticated take on the cocktail bar. The music (funky stuff - Justin Timberlake, Michael Jackson and so on) worked very well with the feel of the place although it could have done with being a fraction quieter. It was quite early in the evening and not that busy but we were having to raise our voices to talk. Nevertheless, it was super-suave - a far cry from our \"usual\" type of place but very impressive and enjoyable.\n\nThere were two choices of both savoury and sweet fondue that night; we went for cider, cheese and bacon, which arrived pretty quickly with a lovely board of dunkables: salmon, mussels, herby chicken, tender beef steak and raw carrot sticks. Heaven! We didn't have that problem that so often occurs with fondue, when you run out of dippy bits before you run out of fondue to dip into. It was superb, and at \u00a316 for both of us together, a pretty cheap way to dine out. We were certainly too full to indulge in a sweet fondue to follow, so that'll have to be a separate trip... oh, so I have to go back? Fine by me!\n\nAs I said, it wasn't that busy. Even though it was early that evening (we were there just before six and stayed until around eight), it definitely deserves to pack out quickly.

Tonight ten happy Yelpers came in to a very quiet Juniper and it took over half an hour to take our drink order, then over another hour to be served the first cocktails.

This made for a long evening of waiting, and some frustrated Yelpers.\n\nI really enjoyed sharing a taster menu of cocktails as it was fun to get to try eight different cocktails and see what we liked best whilst navigating the extensive cocktail menu by taste. The server kindly let us share two taster menus - eight cocktails total - amongst four people but be careful since the menu does state that the \u00a325 cost is per person. If sharing the taster menu with over two people, don't tell them you are sharing it! I think we only got away with it since we were bringing them so much business.

We waited a long time for a waitress to take our initial orders. We waited a long time for tap water to arrive (it came well after the first cocktails, actually). And we waited a long, long time for cocktails. So much so that it became one of the major topics of conversation at our table, wondering when our thirst would be quenched.

Twenty Princes Street is one of the places we never really thought of visiting.  - It actually has one of the 2 only Josper Grills in Edinburgh (the Black Room has the other one) \nIt shares the building of an hotel and Juniper Fondue is on the same floor. The entrance is quite decorative, candles in lanterns placed on the carpeted stairs and a great parquet flooring at the reception. \n\nThe restaurant has several booths and mixes 2-4 seater tables in the middle of the room. It overlooks the Balmoral and the Mount. Quite a sight at night. Possibly even better during Christmas on Princes Street.  \n\nWe were shown our table and our coats were taken to be hung. Looking around it suddenly occurred to me that the flooring (short parqueted) is extremely suited for dancing (no I didn't).

Differing from other Japanese restaurants in Edinburgh by offering some more exotic and authentic Japanese food along with Scottish/Japanese fusion dishes. From what i've read, the menu seems to be kept fresh by changing according to season/availability of the best produce available. Drinks such as Genmai Tea and Ramune Lemonade (worth ordering just for the novelty bottle) also offer a nice alternative to the ubiquitous Green Tea and Asahi. They do not serve alcohol but do have a BYOB policy, without charge.\n\nI had the Agedashi Tofu and assorted Sashimi (including the catch of the day) with Wafu Salad. The first thing I noticed were the portions. They are generous and a little more satisfying in comparison to other Japanese restaurants in town and are certainly good value. The second was the quality of the fish; fresh, perfectly prepared and complimented by crisp vegetables and a sweet, citrus dressing. Even the notoriously flavour-resistant Tofu had a tasty, smoky flavour and light texture, served in a perfectly seasoned Dashi broth. Having eaten previously from their stall at Stockbridge Market I can also vouch for their appetising Gyoza and Udon dishes.\n\nThe staff are faultless. We were greeted by the incredibly hospitable chef/owner Kaori and served by a waitress that obviously knew the menu and Japanese food in general. Overhearing a number of other customers asking questions about dishes, including customisations, which were impressively accommodated without hassle.\n\nMy only criticism would be the lack of seating.

In a delightful pale pink bomb of East Meets West, it fuses soft candlelight, gentle jazz, wooden flooring and chopsticks to create a relaxing and extremely enjoyable mealtime.

The chairs were squashy and high-backed, arranged around a quirky T-shaped table arrangement. Among those of us seated next to the large and beautifully-decorated plate glass window, there was a little shuffling and struggling to slip in and out, but the passing of plates and dishes to those least accessible made for a fun party game and added to the celebratory atmosphere of our gathering. Tanya L had brought hand turkeys, and Julie G, in addition to Gobbles the turkey Beanie Baby, who served as our table mascot, had brought two big boxes with her containing pumpkin pie. The staff, far from being offended that we'd brought our own dessert, were more than happy to take them into the kitchen until they were needed, and even brought out a specially-made pumpkin curry to add to our dinner!\n\nWith two gluten-free diners among our number, the waitresses were also quick to go and check suitable dishes with the kitchen. Clad as they were in stunning fitted dresses heavily laden with mirrors and detailed embroidery, it was a joy to see them float around the restaurant with giant smiles. It felt like they loved being there as much as we did. I had a chat with one of the waitresses about the gorgeous outfit and she confessed she had been thrilled at the opportunity to wear it when she began working there.\n\nLooking at the prices on the menu, I assumed that all the dishes would be tiny tapas-like things, so I ordered two from the starter-ish part of the menu, and a side on my main, knowing full well that Julie G's pumpkin pie was still to come for dessert. Big mistake! It's a wonder I could drag my bulk all the way home after a bunch of little square poppodums, some of Claire L's delicious sweet potato crispy curls, three amazing batata vada (sort of fried spicy potato patties), a grated carrot salad the name of which I can't remember, a thali served in five silver dishes, and a royal raita of seasoned yoghurt topped with what I think was pomegranate seeds. And whenever I felt like my mouth was on fire from all of the spices (perfectly balanced to create, not disguise, flavour) I took a sip of my passion fruit juice. Yes, indeed, passion fruit juice. Why does EVERYWHERE not serve passion fruit juice? I had two glasses of that stuff. And what did my bill come to for everything I ate (apart from the sweet potato curls I snaffled off Claire and the delicious slice of Julie's pie?) \u00a313.50.

The pumpkin curry made specially for our gang celebrating Thanksgiving was so yummy. I did order too much food - the chilli fries were lovely, as were Jenny's casava chips.

The concept of tapas is sharing food however I didn't feel some of the dishes were really sharing friendly. It felt like a bit gimmicky. \n\nThe winning dish for me was the simplest and that was the haloumi and pomegranate tabbouleh. No complaints from the party for the meatballs, prawns or the haggis Bon bons. Yummy... \n\nThe wine wasn't overpriced which Is a trap a lot of new restaurants fall into in the Stockbridge area. I think overall the bill came to around \u00a340 per head which considering we had a 3 course selection of food plates, sides plus 3 bottles of wine, I thought wasn't too bad. Would I go again? Maybe not. However I wouldn't not recommend it for someone to try.

Another bout of akward silence and staring. Normally in this senario people suggest well we could subsitute fish/oyster sauce for soya sauce or similiar.

The two screens (one showing a Champions League footie match on STV, the other showing a different footie match on Sky Sports) were well-placed such that you could position yourself most places in the bar and still get a decent view, added to which the sound on the STV match was up loud enough that it was audible over the chatter (I find commentary one of the most interesting parts of watching sports on telly, so in bars it's normally pointless for me).\n\nAlready well-populated by those in the know and quick off the mark, the place was already thriving with a lovely warm atmosphere; I only just managed to get a stool at the bar. Big tick for the bar stools, by the way - sturdy, in heavy cast iron with good solid wooden seat-tops that spin around for adjustable height (and for ease of fun swivelling).\n\nThe decor is stylish, in a woodeny kind of way, with some seriously cool lightbulbs over the bar (zig-zaggy filament joy) and the staff at the bar were really friendly despite the fact that business was pretty steady and they weren't getting much chance to rest. The menu looks really great - lovely slow-cooked things, burritos, burgers, smoked yumness...

I feel that they have clearly defined what they are about on the outside, but it gets a little bit lost on the inside, and when I say that I am referring to the mixed bag d\u00e9cor. However, service and product is of a very good standard, though that's normally the case when a new bar opens.\n\nThe positives? The beer range is good, real ale, craft beer as well as euro classics available. A good bottled range makes it unlikely that your beer taste won't be met. Their spirit range, however, is a little bit limited, but the basics are there. I haven't looked at their wine list, but I saw their house wine is very cheap (less than \u00a315 a bottle) so that's great - though its almost \u00a35 for some Sam Adams which is classed as a pretty run of the mill beer stateside.\n\nThe food is pretty damn good. We had a sharing platter with a huge portion of meaty flavoursome ribs and half a chicken which was succulent and relatively tasty. They randomly give you a chunk of corn on the cob which isn't really for sharing unless you are happy sharing saliva also?? Each table has good range of sauces, the hot sauce being nice and nippy, though their honey mustard is a bit thin and ergo pointless. Good price point for the food also.\n\nTable service is good and the staff take the time to engage with you, and seeing as they have been mobbed every time I go in, then that's good that they know to acknowledge their guests. I haven't been downstairs but apparently it's a good size also!\n\nMy main issue here is that, similarly to other nearby new pubs, they get a bit lost with the d\u00e9cor and furniture, the booths have random  metal bits, and there is a huge mural which looks like they should have paid more to get it done properly. Random hanging lights and the TVs aren't quite big enough. \n\nThey have also put a Gambling Machine in the corner, which I didn't think was an issue until I saw it, and I realised that none of the boozers I drink in actually have these. On both of my visits I noticed that the younger crowd tends not to use it, if it was my pub, I'd get rid.\n\nUltimately, this is a good bar, and I was pleasantly surprised, and will visit again. The big challenge here is how they will maintain the staffing levels and service, because that will make the difference. With the Southern, Cask & Barrel, and  Reverie flanking it, there is plenty of passing custom to keep it lively.", "business_id": "Hn_H4WACnwLDoZBBY3lc9Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-03-15", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "M4MVVzNPZHiJdnNvWjL8VQ", "review_id": "9TkAT3ZczqLzCWxv-pFTsg", "text": "I'd expected this converted Chinese restaurant to be at the pricey end of the pint spectrum but whilst other craft beers were at the near \u00a34 they at least had Stewarts on at \u00a33.20 + pints are the order of the day & not thirds. \n\nAcoustically it's a noisy establishment, to the extent that there was little point in there being any background music on but it's a good new option on the south side of town for somewhere to go to watch sport on the tv as the screens are well placed and there's a decent amount of seating for groups as well as duos. \n\nThe food menus is of the burgers & hot dogs variety but given the prices I'm likely to go back for food so a 4th star is possibly not far off.

This new bar is the latest addition to the Maclay Inns group, who have overseen a \u00a3400,000 refurbishment of this former Chinese restaurant.  With their new 'fresh food, cooked slow' philosophy and offering of craft beers, I went along to see what it was all about.\n\nI had made the decision to review more pubs and step away (slightly) from my normal fine dining background.  This was also a great chance to mingle with some of the other great bloggers we have in Edinburgh.  Anyway... we were ushered down in to the basement bar at Clerk's where we were warmly greeted with a goodie bag and a drink (mine a Caesar Augustus and Sarah's a prosecco), as well as a promise that 'food would be here soon'.\n\nThe bar itself kind of reminded me more of a Glasgow city centre bar; open and bright upstairs, with a dark and cosy basement you'd expect to find somebody playing an acoustic guitar in.  Not that that's a bad thing. Sarah and I have been on a bit of a nacho binge recently, so the first serving of nachos was most welcome.  First bite was promising, as you could tell these were actually home made, not just poured out of a packet.  The nachos were light and accompanied by a zingy salsa and soothing soured cream.  However, why on earth would you tell me you don't use real cheese?\n\nNext we were presented with some chicken wings in barbecue sauce.  The chicken was tender and the sauce did its job.  At least these were decent sized wings and not those tiny little morsels from a chicken that you probably don't want to know where it came from.\n\nThe staff were keen to chat and talk about their vision behind the bar and get feedback from us bloggers. They were very welcoming and took on any comments professionally.  \n\nNext came a behemoth of a sharing platter, which included 1/2 rack of ribs, 1/2 a chicken, pulled pork and was served with meaty beans and chips.  The team were keen to focus on the slow cooking and home smoking concept, and this would be a real acid test of the execution of that.  The ribs were tasty and tender, which a subtle but not overpowering smokiness to it, which was mirrored with the pulled pork and the chicken.  But, everything seriously lacked seasoning for me and there was no salt and pepper shakers on the tables.  The platter came with a range of sauces in squeezy bottles which was a bit different and i really liked the smoked ketchup.  \n\nI must mention those meaty beans (beans with pulled pork through them in a barbeque sauce) because you could have taken the rest of the food away and just left me with a plate of those.  Clerk's Bar is set up to watch various live sports, and i could see me sitting in there with one of those platters, having a few beers with mates.  Certainly great value at \u00a315 because it could have easily fed four, and with a lot of students in this area, i reckon they could be on to a winner. \n\nAfter a short beer tasting aimed to promote their range of craft beers, even more food was rolled out in the shape of sliders and hot dogs, sadly Sarah and I were too stuffed to taste.

I just don't find too satisfying paying 9\u00a3 for a plate of frozen chips a meager salad and some chicken.", "business_id": "ORI4Yt7lQf18z3x1Rih-Tg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-06-03", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "M_zEpexA5elkXRjikmyZRQ", "review_id": "gnPzgzM4t3emlYwcZkM4aA", "text": "This wee place was certainly an experience.

The veggie options were largely tofu-based, and our new friend, the waiter, encouraged me to try one of them. It was a cheesy, omelettey, garlicy, oniony concoction which would have been lovely for breakfast, but it wasn't quite what I had in mind! I'd be keen to go for one of the tapas options next time. \n\nMy friend's chicken piripiri on the other hand, was a total hit.\n\nI'd go back for the atmosphere and holiday vibes, but I advise to be careful when choosing interesting new dishes.", "business_id": "ORI4Yt7lQf18z3x1Rih-Tg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-06-30", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "sj4mcPRhIIP24Zav7xo-eA", "review_id": "CnJKN3ZIBQAh83IGdDkDmQ", "text": "A small little restaurant with big heart!\n\nThe food is excellent, the guys who work there are really excited about the food and encourage people to try new things.

Or, underwhelming. You get the idea. I so wanted it to be amazing, but it just wasn't and it could be and should be.\n\nI've gone for 3 stars as I feel it's a compromise between what Serrano Manchego has got right, and what it's got wrong. The d\u00e9cor alone warrants a solid 4, verging on to 5. The service and the food are definitely a 2 (\"meh, I've experienced better\", I couldn't have said it better myself!).\n\nI'm going to start with the good. The place looks fantastic. It's all exposed brick and wood with the logo stencilled on the wall. Lovely. Lots of space and tables. A definite thumbs up on this. And I love the concept, a Spanish pincho bar on Leith Walk. Only one beer on draught (Alhambra), bite sized snacks and platters, signature croquettas, great! And erm. That's the good. The d\u00e9cor and the concept.\n\nThe bad? Well I'll start with the service. I'm probably not being fair, as yesterday was their opening night (although as stated on their Facebook page this wasn't a soft opening, it wasn't an exclusive party, it was just open), but given the amount of time they've spent into decorating and sourcing ingredients, they really ought to have trained their staff! I'd be surprised if any of the bar staff/servers has worked in a bar or a restaurant before. Not one of them knew how to pour a pint, so the manager had to teach them on the job, and of course this meant that it took ages to get served (and what's with ringing up a transaction on the sole till before pouring the drinks?). And if you'd ordered food you got a numbered wooden spoon in a glass, fairly standard. But the poor girls serving spent most of the evening wandering about in a daze looking for whoever had ordered that particular dish... The staff were all perfectly nice, they were just all woefully inexperienced. I ought to point out that I was with my boyfriend and sister, both experienced bar staff and servers, so as you can imagine we had little tolerance, but even if I'd been there alone I'd still have been frustrated.\n\nAnd the food, oh the food. A great concept doesn't make up for poor execution. There's a nice sounding selection of cold and hot pinchos, as well as tostados, platters and the croquettas of the day. I don't know if this will always be the case, but they only had one croquette on yesterday, which was haggis. Or was it? I was definitely told it was haggis, but biting into it you'd never have known. Sure, the herbs and spices tasted a little like our national dish, but the texture was creamy and the colour was pale and the taste was bland. What was it?! We also ordered a dish of olives. What we got was a small plate (not a bowl, which would have made more sense), of pitted olives that looked and tasted like they'd come straight from a jar. I don't buy jarred olives at the supermarket, I don't expect to be served them in a bar. And pitted, who serves pitted olives?!\n\nI'd like to say everyone else's food look great, but judging by the table next to us that isn't the case. They'd ordered a platter of manchego, blue cheese, walnuts, quince and raisins that came with no blue cheese. There was an explanation for this, but I didn't catch it, and given they'd only been open for 3 hours at this point I sincerely hope they hadn't run out. Then came the tostados, or bread with a topping. Standard, I know, and I wasn't expecting anything brilliant from a basic open sandwich, but they just looked so uninspiring. Fortunately none of the food is expensive.\n\nI actually feel annoyed about it all. I wanted Serrano Manchego to be brilliant. They've had a great Facebook presence and I know I wasn't the only local eagerly awaiting its opening, and it was packed last night. I want to give them a second chance, because I truly believe that they could be great if only they improve. Please guys, the problems I've identified should be easy to fix! I really hope that in a couple of months time I'll be writing an updated review of 4 or 5 stars.", "business_id": "xT1MO7MLMp3jK4XT1LXiKA", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-07-04", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "LKzqAwgEakQRwM244tEYyQ", "review_id": "u8OvSkGtBzTV7govNv4MZA", "text": "Visited on a hot, sunny evening, to find all outside tables occupied so sat inside. Instantly felt the space didn't work well - NONE of our chairs allowed us to sit our legs under the tables so we were all spaced out beside it, taking up a lot of room and quite uncomfortable. Everyone inside was taking up a lot of room, so that a trip to the bar or bathroom was an obstscle course of sorrys and excuse me's....\n\nThe other main problem was the tiny wee space at the bar for ordering, most of the bar being used for seating, and occupied, so queueing ensued and despite the army of staff behind the small bar, they simply didn't have room to get your order till the person in front was done....\n\nThrow into the mix that there is NO table service, for approx 8 outside tables and maybe 15 squeezed in inside, and i can predict a war on busier days at that teeny weeny service area.. Staff still came from behind the bar to clear empty plates and glasses and refused to take orders and failed to notice who were no doubt ex Dalmany Bar gents getting in thru the (probably illegally) open fire exit and plonking themselves down.\n \nLeith has been teased by their opening for over a year now, and yet i found a toilet with a broken lock and the other with a really broken seat, no toilet paper and very very very dirty floors.

I so very much wanted to enjoy this place. It's always an amazing day when you find that a fairly pretentious coffee house is being replaced with something a lot less so! The restaurant is literally across the road from my work and would be an excellent Friday treat for myself and the rest of the office.\n\nThe decor is typical of a lot of places these days - exposed brickwork, unpainted woodwork, hodge-podge furniture etc. And the staff were very accommodating and friendly. All very much a positive, imo.\n\nThere were 4 of us in our party and the 3 guys all opted for the cheese burger, and 2 of them had fries on the side, and I being veggie, had the 1 option on the menu - the Magic Mushroom Burger. All burgers cost the same amount: \u00a37.50 and this is where things get a bit....erm...meh....\n\nThe food arrived around 30 minutes after we sat down. We were all presented with greaseproof paper mats, on top of which came our paper-wrapped burgers. Call me old fashioned, but I like plates or boards to eat off of! This is essentially fast food at gourmet prices. My \u00a37.50 got me a brioche bun with a mildly spicy bean patty, a mushroom, a dollop of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, a bit of salad and a mildly spicy salsa. It's important to note that all sides are separate. I remember looking enviously at the gherkins which the guys seemed to have and thinking that just a bit of 'pep' might have changed my entire experience. There's a common misconception that veggie sometimes means bland. Maybe the introduction of some spicy condiments might help out here. I felt a little short-changed, if I'm honest. The Southern, for example, offers a multiple choice of veggie options and comes with a side of fries and a side of slaw for around 50p more. \n\nI really don't want this to be a damning review, after all the 3 guys who I was with absolutely loved their meals, but I just came away feeling that the vegetarian option was simply tacked on to appease folk like me. I will go back as my better half wants to check it out, but I think the next time I really want a burger, I will go to the Southern or Wanaburger and get a hell of a lot more bang for my buck, both in terms of value and actual sustenance.", "business_id": "EYpqqsJZ3L2EFAPK-NEOFA", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-07-15", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "LKzqAwgEakQRwM244tEYyQ", "review_id": "oaTZD_BmxUI5PMPKTqjQdw", "text": "Love this place.
