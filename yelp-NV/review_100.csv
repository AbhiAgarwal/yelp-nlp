The smells and the sounds penetrate your senses as your eyes dart from one unique lil object to the next.  It's a great place to go for a different sort of gift, psychic readings or just to browse.  

You can get books, candles, jewelry, incense, gifts from other countries, house decor, meditation tools, and more.

My friends and I like it but only make it in every couple of years, it seems.  Btw.. this is a new location!  Check the address if you're gonna stop in. :)

If you used the iPhone app or FB touch site you could unlock a special coupon when you check-in at the store.  To kick-off the program the deal had to be great... and it was. The first 10,000 customers got a free pair of jeans.

So what that I'm on vacation?! I sure as hell ran right over to Caesar's Palace to score this deal.  When I got there they only had 3 coupons left, so I was very happy.

That was easy part. The hard part was trying to decide what to get.  It's been years since I've bought Gap jeans.  According to them they've come a long way and are more stylish than before.  I'm not so sure that much has changed except adding a ""wash"" to make the denim look like it hadn't been washed.

Anyway, I returned later that afternoon and someone came to help me after he saw that I was staring blankly at the wall of jeans.  He gave a brief explanation of a few things and whisked me back to the dressing room with a few options to try. In addition to a few boot cut and standard men's jeans, he also suggested some women's styles.  I have zero interest in wearing women's clothes, but I tried them on anyway.  Believe it or not, he was right about them looking pretty good. Unfortunately the pockets are really shallow and I just didn't see myself wearing them very much.

36.211152,-115.24878,1,2.5,"In November of 2012 I had a pea sized spot on my underarm that didn't look right, so my PCP referred me to Woodson Dermotology.  

I saw the PA, John.  I made a 7:15am appointment and was seen immediately, literally no wait.  He was VERY nice and examined the spot and informed me that it was ringworm.  I was surprised, as I had ringworm a number of years ago.  But I trusted him and took the pills and cream I was prescribed.  I had a follow-up appoint the next month, and explained to him that it's only getting bigger (MUCH bigger) and didn't look or feel like ringworm.  It was not itchy, did not spread, not scaly, and didn't seem to be contagious.  He reassured me that it ""just presents differently in the armpit"" I was frustrated but took the new pills and creams I was given.  Again, nothing happened except it was getting BIGGER.  I again had a follow up the next month and expressed my concerns AGAIN.  Nothing, just more creams and pills. This went on and on every month until JULY!!!  For 8 freaking months this man told me I had ringworm... ringworm that was not contagious, not itchy, and didn't even resemble ringworm, and NO drugs he gave me had ANY EFFECT WHATS SO EVER.  To me, that would be a red flag that maybe, just maybe I got this diagnosis wrong, but he refused that he could be wrong.  Upon googling it, I read that even UNTREATED ringworm lasts a maximum of 4 months.  

I would much rather hear ""I'm not really sure what this is! Let's do a biopsy, or call in Dr. whoever to get another opinion""  rather than swear you're right when you know you're wrong.  But he is too proud to do that.  

 In July I went in and there was a PA fresh out of school that John was training.  This PA took ONE look at my ""ringworm"" and said there's no way that's ringworm!!!  He said it looked like Granuloma Annulare.  He said he would talk to John and come back in.  All of a sudden John thinks it's this now.  But just to be sure, he gives me yet another cream.  I recognized the name of the cream, so I told him, ""I think you have given me this before"" he said ""hmmm, let me look.... No, we haven't given you any creams before""  I was flabbergasted!  I have had a minimum of 5 creams prescribed to me.  I bit my tongue just wanting this appointment to be over.  He said if this cream didn't fix it they would do a biopsy (why he didn't do that 8 freaking MONTHS ago is beyond me!) so I get home and find the exact same cream that did nothing 3 months before when he prescribed it to me the first time!  I was furious!  I just kept telling myself, ""just get the biopsy and you will never have to go here again!""  So of course nothing changed except it got bigger (about the size of a half dollar now, very visible as it is growing beyond my armpit and onto my arm and looks like a huge human bite mark) and another one growing next to it.  So he decided to do the punch biopsy. 

 At this appointment as well as all the other appointments they asked what I am allergic to.  I read off the list, among them is polysporin.  The assistant was very nice and when she was done she grabbed a Q-tip with a cream on it.  She got about an inch away and I said ""what is that?""  she said ""polysporin""  I quickly yell ""I'm allergic to that!"" before she can get any on me.  Why do you even ask what I am allergic to?  Seriously!  I was supposed to come back 2 weeks later to get the results and get my stitches out. 

 So 2 weeks later I come back to get my Biopsy results and stitches removed. She took out my stitches and started to leave.  I said ""Excuse me, do you have my biopsy results?"" she said ""No"" and started to walk again.  I said ""Are you sure, it's been 2 weeks"" She sighed and actually opened my file this time (imagine that!) and said ""oh yeah, here it is, it's benign""  I said ""ok, but is it the granuloma annulare?"" she said ""yes, that was positive""  I said ""ok, can you tell me what that is or anything about it?""  She said she wasn't familiar with it.  OK...... ""can I talk to John or anyone else that does know?""  She said ""no, they're all busy, but you can make another appointment in a few weeks to talk to him if you have questions"" I was done, didn't give an answer just stormed out, said goodbye and thank you to the only person worth a crap there (the front office) and went home. 

 Why would you have someone give you biopsy results and not tell you anything about it?!?  I have wasted almost a YEAR of my life and missing work to go to these appointments every month, because John was too proud to admit he was wrong.

In fact, they publicize their lunch menu as ""everything under $10,"" so you're pretty much forced to be frugal. If you have been there before, I'd like to let you know it has recently changed management. Apparently the restaurant was going downhill before they did, so if you had a bad experience you might want to try it again.

My Greca salad ($7.95) was quite enjoyable, and a touch unique. It was tossed with a creamy garlic dressing rather than a vinaigrette, which was a nice change, and the feta cheese was not of your standard supermarket variety. This cheese was soft and mild, without much salt. Though I personally prefer feta with a little more tang,  this was of good quality nonetheless and you do get some brininess from the kalamata olives.

My husband had the pastrami sandwich ($9.95) which was tasty but not delivered as promised. Instead of fries it came with a good version of basil mashed potatoes (I still would have preferred fries) and instead of the more appropriate rye bread listed in the description it was served on a soft hoagie. Additionally, the presentation was pretty sloppy as mustard was EVERYWHERE around the outside. There was too much mustard inside the sandwich as well, and it would have benefited from the use of whole grain or deli mustard rather than yellow. I still liked it as the pastrami itself was tender and delicious, but with a little improvement it would have been great.

36.1924136,-115.3043961,2,3.5,"Wanted: atmosphere, good wine and decent food for Sunday -early dinner.
Received: expensive place, mediocre wine and salty, processed food in a place that looked like it had seen better days.

I will start out and say we had the nicest staff! No complaints at all on our service! I feel bad that they have to serve this food in this place and try to do it with a smile. I don't think I could (and I have worked food for years)

We called on the off chance Chianti's would be open on a Sunday- and they were (though they will be closing Sun and Mon for ""the season"" starting next week. I didn't realize there was a season for eating....but we decided to try it  based on the reviews.

We enter, and it is dark and empty  Greeted and seated by lovely Mary who explained it was happy hour and gave us a moment to look over the menus. I had a few questions, ordered a glass of their house cab and my partner ordered chianti on her suggestion. We also ordered the Mozzerella Fritta.

The wine came and the cab was so sweet it tasted like fortified wine. I questioned the bartendress (also lovely) and she tried it and said yes, it was sweeter than normal, would I like something else? I ended up with my bf's chianti (which wasn't amazing, but definitely better). The Fritta came and it was essentially two very large triangles of breaded, frozen moz that were barely cooked through, VERY salty and had chunky tomato sauce on them. Edible, but not fresh.

After looking through the menu and  a few more questions, (Only the Lobster Ravioli are handmade (why not the cheese?)  I decided on the manicoti (which I was told was prepared there) in bechemel sauce with fresh spinach and my bf got the orange roughy special (artichoke hearts, capers and sun dried tomatoes).

We asked about how busy the place was, (Friday night is hopping apparently!) and who the main clientele is (Older people from Sun City) but they get a mix. We were told it dies down in the Summer, which is why they were closing Sun/Mon.

I have now run out of wine, and so started looking through the dirty menus (all four of them were stuck with old food) to select another. I chose a 9/glass McManis cab- and after searching for it- two other opened bottle were brought out because they were ""in the process of drastically cutting down the list"". Neither were great and both had been open at least a day and recorked. I asked them how long each had been open and was told no more than a day on one and 2 at the MOST on the second bottle. If you are going to have wine open at all for more than a day-  vacuum seal it.

Plates come and are as hot as Mary tells us they would be (which means mine has been sitting under some heat lamp for awhile after being microwaved).

The plates look ok- I can do without all the parsley garnish on EVERY plate- but whatever.

The manicoti does have fresh spinach on top, but it is not in a bechemel sauce- it tastes like a who jar of Ragu Alfredo was poured over 3 frozen manicoti and nuked for 4-5 minutes. I understand you have to make things ahead and heat them up sometimes- but at least bake the items! No fresh cheese bubbling- only a thin layer of film from having sat for a minute too long under the lamps while the fish was cooked.
Speaking of the fish- it wasn't bad. Not amazing, and kinda fishy smelling- but edible and nicely presented. Like everything, it was salty and plenty of frozen items were used to concoct it- but edible.

There are now 2 other tables, one of which came just after us and they heard the same thing we did - Fridays are hopping, the chianti is great and Mary recommends the lobster ravioli (at $22, I can see why).
The next table is much more interesting.....having driven all the way across town to be here (really?) but then I hear why. Our bartender's martinis are among the best in town- and probably what we should have ordered to wash the rest of our meal down with! Doh!

End of meal comes- leftovers wrapped  and my bf now wants an espresso or capp.- do they have amachine? Yes. He asks- will I hear the milk froth? No- it comes in a ""pod"". He gets espresso anyhow. No bueno, and has 3 sugars in the espresso cup to just gulp it down. For $3? 

We could not be tempted with the ""Homemade Tiramisu"" so sat and finished our wine while pondering the place.

Our conclusion is that Chianti Cafe needs to contact Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares and get a facelift. There is NO REASON why this place couldn't make it, but there is a WHOLE list of things that need to change. You can tell the owners are feeling the pinch, so have cut as many corners as they can. Sad really- LV doesn't have enough of these small, community spots.
Despite the nice staff, we will not go back (but will check out the new Chronic Tacos that opened next door!)
As for giving Nora's a run? Not a chance! Even at their worst- they use fresh food and have properly stored wine.

Finally a gentleman who had walked by us before asked if we were looking for a table.  Finally we were seated.  We were taken to a table where there was a wine bucket with an empty bottle of wine next to it, which was moved away.  We sat down and the server proceeded to tell us about the items that were not available.  It was still early on a Friday and they were out of many high cost items including steak and clams.  We decided to order a glass of wine to start.  It seemed as if they were short staffed.  So everything took a very long time.  We ordered 2 glasses of wine and an order of bruschetta.  The server returned later with a bottle of wine and informed my husband that they were out of the wine he ordered as well and would he like to have a glass from the bottle she brought over.  Finally,  we got our bar order.  We had been seated for a while.  No bread came.  Then finally about 15 minutes later we were brought a mediocre loaf of white bread. (nothing special).  I went to use my bread plate but it was dirty, it looked clean but felt like it had a dirty film over it.  The bruschetta was finally delivered and it was nothing to get excited over.  The bread was not toasted and it was just chopped tomatoes and garlic on untoasted bread. 
  In the meantime there was a musician who was playing in the dining room.  He sang Billy Joel, Cat Stevens songs kind of your typical lounge songs.  I enjoyed listening to him.  It seemed as if most of the people there were coming to listen to his performance.  A party of 3 people came in to listen to him but 5 more joined them and they needed a bigger table.  They wanted to put 2 tables together but the waitress kept saying that someone would move their tables for them.  Finally, the manager? came over and moved the two tables for them inches away from our table.  We were literally an inch away from 2 people at the table yet there was plenty of room that they could have moved them to the other direction.

One of the few times I did stay in a Vegas hotel, I was co-planning a group trip for about ten people, and the Boulder Station was our weekend headquarters.

Boulder Station isn't especially close to the Strip, although it's not too long of a cab ride if you want to head down for the day.  But if your main reason for coming to Vegas is to lose money at the casinos and gorge yourself on all-you-can-eat buffets, Boulder Station can provide you a full Vegas experience without ever having to leave the premises.

The hotel itself is not fancy, but clean and quiet.  The beds aren't gross, and housekeeping does a fine job.  We never heard any other guests or any disturbances.  The rooms are fine - decorated in a slightly cheesy fashion, but they did at least make the effort - but you're not going to spend much time in your room when there's money to be lost, now are you?  

Boulder Station has plenty of dining choices for you.  The Feast Buffet is a pretty typical all-you-can-eat - we went when it was transitioning from breakfast to lunch, and it had the usual fruit-and-salad bar, hot dishes, and carving station.  The Boulder Cafe is a casual family-dining type place with bland, decent, but unremarkable food.  The Pasta Palace is their nicest restaurant, and it has a pretty, vaguely Tuscan-style interior, but the food isn't worth the high prices - just your standard Olive Garden stuff.  For those who prefer their food franchised and nationally branded, there's also a Subway, a Starbucks, and a Winchell's Donuts.

In addition to all the usual table games, slots and video poker, Boulder Station also has a Regal movie theater and a kids' arcade (because, you know, Vegas is such a family-friendly place).  There are several bars scattered around, and apparently a showroom called the Railhead, which I can't personally speak for.

With reasonable room rates, clean and quiet accommodations, and slots that are just as money-hungry as any other Vegas casino, save yourself a grip of cash by staying off the Strip.  Compared to places that outfit their staff in gladiator costumes or medieval garb, Boulder Station is - dare I say it? - a slightly classier Vegas alternative.",0.0232791327913,453,3.6,2006-04,33,0,3,3

Room rates can be amazingly cheap if you go mid-week (Mon - Thur), but like everything else in Vegas, they shoot up on the weekend. But it doesn't feel cheap. The room I got was clean, adequately furnished and decorated. 

However, there are several lamps in the room but they are all rather dim. I had to turn on all of them. I also had an issue with getting hot water my first night ... I had to run the shower for at least 10 minutes before any hot water came out.

I've never been a fan of Vegas. The Strip: it's a twisted Fantasyland with its delicate balancing act of catering to both families and opulent adult excesses. Likewise, Downtown Las Vegas has fallen into the marching order with its Fremont Street Experience, the holographic whales drifting above craning heads; a virtual LSD trip but without the dangerous free-fall. 

Sometimes you just don't want to fight the crowds, and when the bells, whistles, and flashing lights get too much, always remember that there are places like Boulder Station.

Located on Boulder Highway yards from the off ramps of Interstate-515, Boulder Station has everything you need on your search for the American Dream: casino, buffet, movie theater, a decent bed. It's not what you'd call ""swanky"", but it'll do. The casino is theme-free, lacking any sort of glitzy pretense or staffers who must stay ""in character""; the buffet, not the best you'll have nor the worst, is a perfect place to land, refuel, and takeoff on your middle-stakes red-eye; the Edwards Theater within the complex features screening rooms small enough for a house in the Hollywood Hills, but who really notices once the movie's started?

Our room was a-okay. It's no suite at the Wynn but the room was perfect enough for our needs: a clean place to sleep and to get tidied-up. Really, what else do you need?? The only complaint by the wife was that the hairdryer did not work, but other than that, I would totally stay here again.

Oh, did I mention I won about eighty dollars on a penny machine? Yeah, the credits came in handy for killing time. 

I learned that the Station Casinos tend to attract Las Vegas locals, and that is what made this place so awesome to me. The people-watching here is different than the more touristy spots in this evil, evil city. The bar downstairs clears its dance floor and becomes an open air club, the unseen DJ fueling a crazed moshpit filled with all manner of shapes, sizes, and ages: the crazy old man with the cobra-quick moves flying solo, yet at the same time friends with everyone; the twenty-something blonde in the black dress gyrating before a pimp-a-licious paraplegic, then turning around to reveal someone old enough to be his mother. YOW!! Even so, this place seemed more ""real"" to me than the touristy places in this crazy City.
 
What I liked about Boulder Station is that it doesn't pretend to be something that it's not, and despite all that glitters in Vegas, this very thing is what made this place all the more rooted in reality. The true Vegas experience, I discovered, is not the New York skyline, faux pirates looting a ship, or roman soldiers taking your photo, but the unpolished flair that only the local flavor can impart to a place like this.

I may not have found the American Dream at Boulder Station, but  the price was right, the accommodations were adequate, I had a great time, and for the first time, with all the lucidity I can muster, I can honestly say, ""God, I love this town.""",0.108148818395,189,3.85,2008-07,16,4,7,4

This message should begin with a small disclaimer: I'm gay which entitles me to the be a drama queen at times.  With that said get ready for an academy award winning performance by yours truly.

Where is the 0 stars b-t- dubs....  So this review is long overdue but I was letting the poison pen ferment to its fullest and wanted the noose I let them hang themselves as tight as it would go.  We are there finally! Yay

So about 2 months ago I went to Las Vegas for the 2nd time this year.  It's one of my favorite spots in the country, even though I don't gamble.  I go for the shows and the sexy gay boys that never get to go out but work in a city they hate living in.   Anyway on this trip I decided an off the strip stay would do.  It was last minute planning and was mainly to hang out with 2 friends I have made out there from my numerous trips over the years.  One was turning 30.  I picked a hotel by their place so they could visit whenever they wanted.  I suppose I should have known better.  

Upon check in I was greeted by a friendly woman and it all looked like it wouldn't be so bad.  I had done my research on this hotel and saw that they had 3 room options.  I opted for their suite (or so I thought).  I got up to my room to find a large(ish) room with a hot tub.  I had traveled from Boston on standby (buddy pass) and was miserable and just wanted to sleep since it was 12  am Vegas time. I decided to confront the issue in the morning.  I woke at 10 30 and made some coffee before venturing downstairs at about 11:30 am to discuss the issue.  

I approached the desk knowing I needed to talk with the manager but giving a brief version to the man at the desk.  I wanted to be sure I wasn't accidently placed in the room I believed to be their ""deluxe room"" emphasis on room.  The gentleman got the manager who sashayed to the desk ready to fight.  I immediately thought of rupaul shantee you stay shashay away!  You better work!  I explained my story to her and let her know I saw 3 options on the site standard ROOM deluxe ROOM and a SUITE.  I then went to the reservation to find 2 choices a standard ROOM and a deluxe SUITE.  I assumed the deluxe was there to make the suite sound more exciting.  She explained that no the Deluxe suite is actually the deluxe room.  I told her that her website was deceptive and I wanted to either be moved to a suite for the rate that I was quoted online or I wanted to be refunded the difference for the room for the night before and moved to a standard room where I would spend the remainder of my trip.  She said their was nothing at all she could do for me.  I quickly corrected her and said a refund for the remainder of the trip would also solve the problem for the remainer of the stay because this poorly decorated excuse for a hotel would not see another penny of mine.  She honored this request and I checked out about 45 minutes later and made way to the marriott to use some rewards points.  

I am not a hard person to make happy she could have given me a casino credit (please note I don't gamble) and I'd have been like hey at least she's making an effort to keep me happy.  But no this lady was not in the market of making me happy. 

Upon arriving home I decided to write a letter to management highlighting the details of the event and being sure to include reminders that you should keep customers happy because we are the reason they are in business.  I even threw in some fun facts about me like a hospitality industry from professional for almost 15 years with a degree from the top hospitality college in the country and my companion being a legacy airline flight attendant that flies to Vegas often as well.  I even let them know that I am understanding when it comes to having a bad day and would gladly accept an apology (fine this part was implied but I made sure it was implied). Well they've had over months and have run out of limbs to prevent the noose from tigthening.  This review, which I plan on posting in numerous sites is a warning to all that this casino does not know how to treat their guests and  to stay away.  Their management staff does not care about anything other than the dollars you put in their machines.  There are many options for resorts and hotels in the Vegas area.  The 130 I spent a room there could have got me a much nicer one at any of the strip hotels that were more than 3 years old but are still gorgeous.  I",0.203670634921,21,3.37,2008-01,1,1,0,0

The quality and selection with attentive service, in my opinion is a super deal. Lately Station Casinos reduced their prices on buffets. For what I got on a Saturday afternoon for less $8, impressed me. Regardless that there was a lengthy line, it moved fast, and oldies music made it enjoyable.

Everything is standard, nothing that is so enticing as to drag make me drive 20 miles just to visit, but if you're in the area, it's a pretty good little locals casino.",0.194136518244,1163,3.77,2010-10,60,0,3,2

I just wish that it would open up earlier than 8 AM, to accommodate locals going to work.  And the price (if you have an affinity card) is certainly more than reasonable.  The servers are, for the most part, very friendly and personable, and you should generously tip them.  The omelet station produces flawless egg creations to your exacting specifications.

I only stayed in one of their hotel rooms for one night (March 17, 2012) and didn't feel that the room charge was reasonable, considering what I got in return.

I'd certianly give this place a good recommendation, as far as the restaurants and the gaming is concerned.  But as far as the hotel goes, I believe you could do much better.",0.28671875,103,4.21,2012-02,5,0,0,0

Once we entered the room, the smoke smell was a bit overwhelming. Fortunately one of us came prepared and we solved that quickly. The room was pretty clean, and the beds mostly comfortable. Flat screen tv, but channels were limited and  weren't identified on the screen as the channel was changed.

Food- the Mexican restaurant had a great happy hour menu, with a great Coronarita for $8 or $10, the buffet was pretty darn good as well. On Sunday, go to the buffet early, or mid afternoon, as it was crowded and we went back twice.

We stayed Friday and Saturday, and on a whim checked the room out online to stay Sunday, and did so for an additional $16!! Yes, please!!!

Anyway, that didn't feel good at all. Sams Town Casino's theater DOES NOT do that!  If it WAS a weapons check, why only my bag and not the guys? Guns are brought in not only in bags but also hidden under men's shirts. So I don't think it was a weapons search. I really suspect that they were checking for anything brought in from home to snack on or drink (such as bottled water or soda).  After what happened and also the higher prices, we decided that this would be the last time we went to the Boulder Station's theater.",0.144791666667,75,3.79,2012-01,1,1,0,0

As soon as we pulled up front we were greeted by Valet and he took care of us rather fast and was very friendly, he called for a bell boy who took all of our luggage. 
My girlfriend and I went to check in and there was no wait, the gentlemen who checked us in did just that but nothing further. I asked him for tips on what to do in the hotel, he didn't seem to have a good connection or experience to give me advice. I also asked what was good to eat in the hotel since we were super hungry, his suggestion seemed as he just read a Boucher and repeated what it said. 
The walk from the front desk is a good distance from the hotel, but that was okay as we were able to walk by the restaurants, and see a bit of the casino. 
Okay Yelpers, the reviews are not all good on here, and I was SUPER worried what we got into, the appearance seemed clean, but we knew it was a 50/50...
As we walked in, it was a HUGE RELIEF the room was SUPER nice, and Very Clean. No problems with smoke at all. The bed was also very comfy. 
The next morning we wanted to check out the buffet as we walked up the line was too long for me. 
We kept walking, and right next door was a little restaurant.
We got seated pretty fast, and the waitress came rather fast and offered us the specials. The food was great, and the waitress was also great.
The casino is a good size and had a lot of slot play. They do have a rewards card that gets you some advantages. We went to the desk, and there was no line and three people working. The lady we went up to seemed as we interrupted her conversation with the other ladies behind the desk. She seemed as she did not want to help us and our questions were just an interruption to her day. 
Our check out was easy, and fast. The lady who checked us out was very nice.
Over all I would highly recommend this place if you don't mind being away from the strip. I am very picky and if it was going to be sketchy or dirty to us we would have left. I was very VERY surprised on how clean and updated everything seemed to be.
If management reads this, the way you are teaching your valet team, and bell boys to conversant and give a good reputation for customer service I would suggest to do the same with the front desk, and rewards card desk. 
Usually customer service would drag my stars down, however we did run into a few very helpful people.
The prices from a third party booking agency online got us a GREAT DEAL. There is a resort fee just keep that in mind.",0.26604886399,26,3.38,2010-03,0,0,2,2

Where to start...

First - VERY ghetto and sketchy location. Don't show up / check- in after dark. Like others have mentioned... there are prostitutes that meander the parking lot. We arrived around 7pm and took the last parking space in the open outside lot. The two cars we parked in between had 4 girls smoking weed in one, and two shirtless men that were reclined all the way back in the other.  *Hrmm, somethings not right here*  

If you are checking in, just pull up to the valet area and have someone stay in the car there. The check in line was painful as there was only 1 customer rep and there were 4 people ahead of us. We were getting worried since it was taking so long and due to the people/cars we parked next to. I was praying the car wasn't getting broken into while we were waiting in line. 

The front and interior area smelled old and similar to bathroom cleaner which was replaced by the overwhelming cigarette smell as we walked further into the casino area.  We parked in the parking garage which was empty - again sketchy - and then proceeded to get lost trying to find the elevators since the front person gave us the wrong directions. 

The room was clean and didn't smell like smoke but we booked 1 king and ended up with 2 queens. We didn't fuss about it but just fyi to make sure you check if you need one or the other.

The casino tables are crap. The croupiers are not as helpful as other casinos and didn't seem to care about us having fun. I did like the slots but only for the points and how they earned in comparison to other casinos. I found one that was right in front of a bar so we were able to finally get drinks but expect a long wait if you are not close by. 

The kid zone looked odd, kinda like a big Mc Donalds play land. I don't recommend it but there were parents dropping their kids off there and at the movie theater next to it. 

The food is the only reason this place gets a 2 star.  Be advised its a LONG wait unless you are going at an odd time, and the it's still a 15 minute wait. The food was great at both the buffet and the cafe. We ordered from the cafe next door and it was AWESOME food for so cheap. We were stuffed!!  And our bill with two drinks (no booze since we brought ours from the casino) was $8. 

Oh yea and they charge you fees for internet, newspapers and the pool- which are not negotiable. What ticked us off the most though- we stayed 3 nights and only got 2 newspapers - really? You charge for the newspapers and all and don't even deliver them?!  And the pool is a little dinky pool.  I rather go somewhere else that you get what you pay for. The fee doubled our room rate which we could have paid elsewhere closer to Fremont and the strip.  We will not be going back.",0.0426263362488,100,3.52,2012-03,2,0,0,0
