The smells and the sounds penetrate your senses as your eyes dart from one unique lil object to the next.  It's a great place to go for a different sort of gift, psychic readings or just to browse.  

You can get books, candles, jewelry, incense, gifts from other countries, house decor, meditation tools, and more.

My friends and I like it but only make it in every couple of years, it seems.  Btw.. this is a new location!  Check the address if you're gonna stop in. :)

If you used the iPhone app or FB touch site you could unlock a special coupon when you check-in at the store.  To kick-off the program the deal had to be great... and it was. The first 10,000 customers got a free pair of jeans.

So what that I'm on vacation?! I sure as hell ran right over to Caesar's Palace to score this deal.  When I got there they only had 3 coupons left, so I was very happy.

That was easy part. The hard part was trying to decide what to get.  It's been years since I've bought Gap jeans.  According to them they've come a long way and are more stylish than before.  I'm not so sure that much has changed except adding a ""wash"" to make the denim look like it hadn't been washed.

Anyway, I returned later that afternoon and someone came to help me after he saw that I was staring blankly at the wall of jeans.  He gave a brief explanation of a few things and whisked me back to the dressing room with a few options to try. In addition to a few boot cut and standard men's jeans, he also suggested some women's styles.  I have zero interest in wearing women's clothes, but I tried them on anyway.  Believe it or not, he was right about them looking pretty good. Unfortunately the pockets are really shallow and I just didn't see myself wearing them very much.

36.211152,-115.24878,1,2.5,"In November of 2012 I had a pea sized spot on my underarm that didn't look right, so my PCP referred me to Woodson Dermotology.  

I saw the PA, John.  I made a 7:15am appointment and was seen immediately, literally no wait.  He was VERY nice and examined the spot and informed me that it was ringworm.  I was surprised, as I had ringworm a number of years ago.  But I trusted him and took the pills and cream I was prescribed.  I had a follow-up appoint the next month, and explained to him that it's only getting bigger (MUCH bigger) and didn't look or feel like ringworm.  It was not itchy, did not spread, not scaly, and didn't seem to be contagious.  He reassured me that it ""just presents differently in the armpit"" I was frustrated but took the new pills and creams I was given.  Again, nothing happened except it was getting BIGGER.  I again had a follow up the next month and expressed my concerns AGAIN.  Nothing, just more creams and pills. This went on and on every month until JULY!!!  For 8 freaking months this man told me I had ringworm... ringworm that was not contagious, not itchy, and didn't even resemble ringworm, and NO drugs he gave me had ANY EFFECT WHATS SO EVER.  To me, that would be a red flag that maybe, just maybe I got this diagnosis wrong, but he refused that he could be wrong.  Upon googling it, I read that even UNTREATED ringworm lasts a maximum of 4 months.  

I would much rather hear ""I'm not really sure what this is! Let's do a biopsy, or call in Dr. whoever to get another opinion""  rather than swear you're right when you know you're wrong.  But he is too proud to do that.  

 In July I went in and there was a PA fresh out of school that John was training.  This PA took ONE look at my ""ringworm"" and said there's no way that's ringworm!!!  He said it looked like Granuloma Annulare.  He said he would talk to John and come back in.  All of a sudden John thinks it's this now.  But just to be sure, he gives me yet another cream.  I recognized the name of the cream, so I told him, ""I think you have given me this before"" he said ""hmmm, let me look.... No, we haven't given you any creams before""  I was flabbergasted!  I have had a minimum of 5 creams prescribed to me.  I bit my tongue just wanting this appointment to be over.  He said if this cream didn't fix it they would do a biopsy (why he didn't do that 8 freaking MONTHS ago is beyond me!) so I get home and find the exact same cream that did nothing 3 months before when he prescribed it to me the first time!  I was furious!  I just kept telling myself, ""just get the biopsy and you will never have to go here again!""  So of course nothing changed except it got bigger (about the size of a half dollar now, very visible as it is growing beyond my armpit and onto my arm and looks like a huge human bite mark) and another one growing next to it.  So he decided to do the punch biopsy. 

 At this appointment as well as all the other appointments they asked what I am allergic to.  I read off the list, among them is polysporin.  The assistant was very nice and when she was done she grabbed a Q-tip with a cream on it.  She got about an inch away and I said ""what is that?""  she said ""polysporin""  I quickly yell ""I'm allergic to that!"" before she can get any on me.  Why do you even ask what I am allergic to?  Seriously!  I was supposed to come back 2 weeks later to get the results and get my stitches out. 

 So 2 weeks later I come back to get my Biopsy results and stitches removed. She took out my stitches and started to leave.  I said ""Excuse me, do you have my biopsy results?"" she said ""No"" and started to walk again.  I said ""Are you sure, it's been 2 weeks"" She sighed and actually opened my file this time (imagine that!) and said ""oh yeah, here it is, it's benign""  I said ""ok, but is it the granuloma annulare?"" she said ""yes, that was positive""  I said ""ok, can you tell me what that is or anything about it?""  She said she wasn't familiar with it.  OK...... ""can I talk to John or anyone else that does know?""  She said ""no, they're all busy, but you can make another appointment in a few weeks to talk to him if you have questions"" I was done, didn't give an answer just stormed out, said goodbye and thank you to the only person worth a crap there (the front office) and went home. 

 Why would you have someone give you biopsy results and not tell you anything about it?!?  I have wasted almost a YEAR of my life and missing work to go to these appointments every month, because John was too proud to admit he was wrong.

In fact, they publicize their lunch menu as ""everything under $10,"" so you're pretty much forced to be frugal. If you have been there before, I'd like to let you know it has recently changed management. Apparently the restaurant was going downhill before they did, so if you had a bad experience you might want to try it again.

My Greca salad ($7.95) was quite enjoyable, and a touch unique. It was tossed with a creamy garlic dressing rather than a vinaigrette, which was a nice change, and the feta cheese was not of your standard supermarket variety. This cheese was soft and mild, without much salt. Though I personally prefer feta with a little more tang,  this was of good quality nonetheless and you do get some brininess from the kalamata olives.

My husband had the pastrami sandwich ($9.95) which was tasty but not delivered as promised. Instead of fries it came with a good version of basil mashed potatoes (I still would have preferred fries) and instead of the more appropriate rye bread listed in the description it was served on a soft hoagie. Additionally, the presentation was pretty sloppy as mustard was EVERYWHERE around the outside. There was too much mustard inside the sandwich as well, and it would have benefited from the use of whole grain or deli mustard rather than yellow. I still liked it as the pastrami itself was tender and delicious, but with a little improvement it would have been great.

36.1924136,-115.3043961,2,3.5,"Wanted: atmosphere, good wine and decent food for Sunday -early dinner.
Received: expensive place, mediocre wine and salty, processed food in a place that looked like it had seen better days.

I will start out and say we had the nicest staff! No complaints at all on our service! I feel bad that they have to serve this food in this place and try to do it with a smile. I don't think I could (and I have worked food for years)

We called on the off chance Chianti's would be open on a Sunday- and they were (though they will be closing Sun and Mon for ""the season"" starting next week. I didn't realize there was a season for eating....but we decided to try it  based on the reviews.

We enter, and it is dark and empty  Greeted and seated by lovely Mary who explained it was happy hour and gave us a moment to look over the menus. I had a few questions, ordered a glass of their house cab and my partner ordered chianti on her suggestion. We also ordered the Mozzerella Fritta.

The wine came and the cab was so sweet it tasted like fortified wine. I questioned the bartendress (also lovely) and she tried it and said yes, it was sweeter than normal, would I like something else? I ended up with my bf's chianti (which wasn't amazing, but definitely better). The Fritta came and it was essentially two very large triangles of breaded, frozen moz that were barely cooked through, VERY salty and had chunky tomato sauce on them. Edible, but not fresh.

After looking through the menu and  a few more questions, (Only the Lobster Ravioli are handmade (why not the cheese?)  I decided on the manicoti (which I was told was prepared there) in bechemel sauce with fresh spinach and my bf got the orange roughy special (artichoke hearts, capers and sun dried tomatoes).

We asked about how busy the place was, (Friday night is hopping apparently!) and who the main clientele is (Older people from Sun City) but they get a mix. We were told it dies down in the Summer, which is why they were closing Sun/Mon.

I have now run out of wine, and so started looking through the dirty menus (all four of them were stuck with old food) to select another. I chose a 9/glass McManis cab- and after searching for it- two other opened bottle were brought out because they were ""in the process of drastically cutting down the list"". Neither were great and both had been open at least a day and recorked. I asked them how long each had been open and was told no more than a day on one and 2 at the MOST on the second bottle. If you are going to have wine open at all for more than a day-  vacuum seal it.

Plates come and are as hot as Mary tells us they would be (which means mine has been sitting under some heat lamp for awhile after being microwaved).

The plates look ok- I can do without all the parsley garnish on EVERY plate- but whatever.

The manicoti does have fresh spinach on top, but it is not in a bechemel sauce- it tastes like a who jar of Ragu Alfredo was poured over 3 frozen manicoti and nuked for 4-5 minutes. I understand you have to make things ahead and heat them up sometimes- but at least bake the items! No fresh cheese bubbling- only a thin layer of film from having sat for a minute too long under the lamps while the fish was cooked.
Speaking of the fish- it wasn't bad. Not amazing, and kinda fishy smelling- but edible and nicely presented. Like everything, it was salty and plenty of frozen items were used to concoct it- but edible.

There are now 2 other tables, one of which came just after us and they heard the same thing we did - Fridays are hopping, the chianti is great and Mary recommends the lobster ravioli (at $22, I can see why).
The next table is much more interesting.....having driven all the way across town to be here (really?) but then I hear why. Our bartender's martinis are among the best in town- and probably what we should have ordered to wash the rest of our meal down with! Doh!

End of meal comes- leftovers wrapped  and my bf now wants an espresso or capp.- do they have amachine? Yes. He asks- will I hear the milk froth? No- it comes in a ""pod"". He gets espresso anyhow. No bueno, and has 3 sugars in the espresso cup to just gulp it down. For $3? 

We could not be tempted with the ""Homemade Tiramisu"" so sat and finished our wine while pondering the place.

Our conclusion is that Chianti Cafe needs to contact Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares and get a facelift. There is NO REASON why this place couldn't make it, but there is a WHOLE list of things that need to change. You can tell the owners are feeling the pinch, so have cut as many corners as they can. Sad really- LV doesn't have enough of these small, community spots.
Despite the nice staff, we will not go back (but will check out the new Chronic Tacos that opened next door!)
As for giving Nora's a run? Not a chance! Even at their worst- they use fresh food and have properly stored wine.

Finally a gentleman who had walked by us before asked if we were looking for a table.  Finally we were seated.  We were taken to a table where there was a wine bucket with an empty bottle of wine next to it, which was moved away.  We sat down and the server proceeded to tell us about the items that were not available.  It was still early on a Friday and they were out of many high cost items including steak and clams.  We decided to order a glass of wine to start.  It seemed as if they were short staffed.  So everything took a very long time.  We ordered 2 glasses of wine and an order of bruschetta.  The server returned later with a bottle of wine and informed my husband that they were out of the wine he ordered as well and would he like to have a glass from the bottle she brought over.  Finally,  we got our bar order.  We had been seated for a while.  No bread came.  Then finally about 15 minutes later we were brought a mediocre loaf of white bread. (nothing special).  I went to use my bread plate but it was dirty, it looked clean but felt like it had a dirty film over it.  The bruschetta was finally delivered and it was nothing to get excited over.  The bread was not toasted and it was just chopped tomatoes and garlic on untoasted bread. 
  In the meantime there was a musician who was playing in the dining room.  He sang Billy Joel, Cat Stevens songs kind of your typical lounge songs.  I enjoyed listening to him.  It seemed as if most of the people there were coming to listen to his performance.  A party of 3 people came in to listen to him but 5 more joined them and they needed a bigger table.  They wanted to put 2 tables together but the waitress kept saying that someone would move their tables for them.  Finally, the manager? came over and moved the two tables for them inches away from our table.  We were literally an inch away from 2 people at the table yet there was plenty of room that they could have moved them to the other direction.

One of the few times I did stay in a Vegas hotel, I was co-planning a group trip for about ten people, and the Boulder Station was our weekend headquarters.

Boulder Station isn't especially close to the Strip, although it's not too long of a cab ride if you want to head down for the day.  But if your main reason for coming to Vegas is to lose money at the casinos and gorge yourself on all-you-can-eat buffets, Boulder Station can provide you a full Vegas experience without ever having to leave the premises.

The hotel itself is not fancy, but clean and quiet.  The beds aren't gross, and housekeeping does a fine job.  We never heard any other guests or any disturbances.  The rooms are fine - decorated in a slightly cheesy fashion, but they did at least make the effort - but you're not going to spend much time in your room when there's money to be lost, now are you?  

Boulder Station has plenty of dining choices for you.  The Feast Buffet is a pretty typical all-you-can-eat - we went when it was transitioning from breakfast to lunch, and it had the usual fruit-and-salad bar, hot dishes, and carving station.  The Boulder Cafe is a casual family-dining type place with bland, decent, but unremarkable food.  The Pasta Palace is their nicest restaurant, and it has a pretty, vaguely Tuscan-style interior, but the food isn't worth the high prices - just your standard Olive Garden stuff.  For those who prefer their food franchised and nationally branded, there's also a Subway, a Starbucks, and a Winchell's Donuts.

In addition to all the usual table games, slots and video poker, Boulder Station also has a Regal movie theater and a kids' arcade (because, you know, Vegas is such a family-friendly place).  There are several bars scattered around, and apparently a showroom called the Railhead, which I can't personally speak for.

With reasonable room rates, clean and quiet accommodations, and slots that are just as money-hungry as any other Vegas casino, save yourself a grip of cash by staying off the Strip.  Compared to places that outfit their staff in gladiator costumes or medieval garb, Boulder Station is - dare I say it? - a slightly classier Vegas alternative.",0.0232791327913,453,3.6,2006-04,33,0,3,3

Room rates can be amazingly cheap if you go mid-week (Mon - Thur), but like everything else in Vegas, they shoot up on the weekend. But it doesn't feel cheap. The room I got was clean, adequately furnished and decorated. 

However, there are several lamps in the room but they are all rather dim. I had to turn on all of them. I also had an issue with getting hot water my first night ... I had to run the shower for at least 10 minutes before any hot water came out.

I've never been a fan of Vegas. The Strip: it's a twisted Fantasyland with its delicate balancing act of catering to both families and opulent adult excesses. Likewise, Downtown Las Vegas has fallen into the marching order with its Fremont Street Experience, the holographic whales drifting above craning heads; a virtual LSD trip but without the dangerous free-fall. 

Sometimes you just don't want to fight the crowds, and when the bells, whistles, and flashing lights get too much, always remember that there are places like Boulder Station.

Located on Boulder Highway yards from the off ramps of Interstate-515, Boulder Station has everything you need on your search for the American Dream: casino, buffet, movie theater, a decent bed. It's not what you'd call ""swanky"", but it'll do. The casino is theme-free, lacking any sort of glitzy pretense or staffers who must stay ""in character""; the buffet, not the best you'll have nor the worst, is a perfect place to land, refuel, and takeoff on your middle-stakes red-eye; the Edwards Theater within the complex features screening rooms small enough for a house in the Hollywood Hills, but who really notices once the movie's started?

Our room was a-okay. It's no suite at the Wynn but the room was perfect enough for our needs: a clean place to sleep and to get tidied-up. Really, what else do you need?? The only complaint by the wife was that the hairdryer did not work, but other than that, I would totally stay here again.

Oh, did I mention I won about eighty dollars on a penny machine? Yeah, the credits came in handy for killing time. 

I learned that the Station Casinos tend to attract Las Vegas locals, and that is what made this place so awesome to me. The people-watching here is different than the more touristy spots in this evil, evil city. The bar downstairs clears its dance floor and becomes an open air club, the unseen DJ fueling a crazed moshpit filled with all manner of shapes, sizes, and ages: the crazy old man with the cobra-quick moves flying solo, yet at the same time friends with everyone; the twenty-something blonde in the black dress gyrating before a pimp-a-licious paraplegic, then turning around to reveal someone old enough to be his mother. YOW!! Even so, this place seemed more ""real"" to me than the touristy places in this crazy City.
 
What I liked about Boulder Station is that it doesn't pretend to be something that it's not, and despite all that glitters in Vegas, this very thing is what made this place all the more rooted in reality. The true Vegas experience, I discovered, is not the New York skyline, faux pirates looting a ship, or roman soldiers taking your photo, but the unpolished flair that only the local flavor can impart to a place like this.

I may not have found the American Dream at Boulder Station, but  the price was right, the accommodations were adequate, I had a great time, and for the first time, with all the lucidity I can muster, I can honestly say, ""God, I love this town.""",0.108148818395,189,3.85,2008-07,16,4,7,4

This message should begin with a small disclaimer: I'm gay which entitles me to the be a drama queen at times.  With that said get ready for an academy award winning performance by yours truly.

Where is the 0 stars b-t- dubs....  So this review is long overdue but I was letting the poison pen ferment to its fullest and wanted the noose I let them hang themselves as tight as it would go.  We are there finally! Yay

So about 2 months ago I went to Las Vegas for the 2nd time this year.  It's one of my favorite spots in the country, even though I don't gamble.  I go for the shows and the sexy gay boys that never get to go out but work in a city they hate living in.   Anyway on this trip I decided an off the strip stay would do.  It was last minute planning and was mainly to hang out with 2 friends I have made out there from my numerous trips over the years.  One was turning 30.  I picked a hotel by their place so they could visit whenever they wanted.  I suppose I should have known better.  

Upon check in I was greeted by a friendly woman and it all looked like it wouldn't be so bad.  I had done my research on this hotel and saw that they had 3 room options.  I opted for their suite (or so I thought).  I got up to my room to find a large(ish) room with a hot tub.  I had traveled from Boston on standby (buddy pass) and was miserable and just wanted to sleep since it was 12  am Vegas time. I decided to confront the issue in the morning.  I woke at 10 30 and made some coffee before venturing downstairs at about 11:30 am to discuss the issue.  

I approached the desk knowing I needed to talk with the manager but giving a brief version to the man at the desk.  I wanted to be sure I wasn't accidently placed in the room I believed to be their ""deluxe room"" emphasis on room.  The gentleman got the manager who sashayed to the desk ready to fight.  I immediately thought of rupaul shantee you stay shashay away!  You better work!  I explained my story to her and let her know I saw 3 options on the site standard ROOM deluxe ROOM and a SUITE.  I then went to the reservation to find 2 choices a standard ROOM and a deluxe SUITE.  I assumed the deluxe was there to make the suite sound more exciting.  She explained that no the Deluxe suite is actually the deluxe room.  I told her that her website was deceptive and I wanted to either be moved to a suite for the rate that I was quoted online or I wanted to be refunded the difference for the room for the night before and moved to a standard room where I would spend the remainder of my trip.  She said their was nothing at all she could do for me.  I quickly corrected her and said a refund for the remainder of the trip would also solve the problem for the remainer of the stay because this poorly decorated excuse for a hotel would not see another penny of mine.  She honored this request and I checked out about 45 minutes later and made way to the marriott to use some rewards points.  

I am not a hard person to make happy she could have given me a casino credit (please note I don't gamble) and I'd have been like hey at least she's making an effort to keep me happy.  But no this lady was not in the market of making me happy. 

Upon arriving home I decided to write a letter to management highlighting the details of the event and being sure to include reminders that you should keep customers happy because we are the reason they are in business.  I even threw in some fun facts about me like a hospitality industry from professional for almost 15 years with a degree from the top hospitality college in the country and my companion being a legacy airline flight attendant that flies to Vegas often as well.  I even let them know that I am understanding when it comes to having a bad day and would gladly accept an apology (fine this part was implied but I made sure it was implied). Well they've had over months and have run out of limbs to prevent the noose from tigthening.  This review, which I plan on posting in numerous sites is a warning to all that this casino does not know how to treat their guests and  to stay away.  Their management staff does not care about anything other than the dollars you put in their machines.  There are many options for resorts and hotels in the Vegas area.  The 130 I spent a room there could have got me a much nicer one at any of the strip hotels that were more than 3 years old but are still gorgeous.  I",0.203670634921,21,3.37,2008-01,1,1,0,0

The quality and selection with attentive service, in my opinion is a super deal. Lately Station Casinos reduced their prices on buffets. For what I got on a Saturday afternoon for less $8, impressed me. Regardless that there was a lengthy line, it moved fast, and oldies music made it enjoyable.

Once we entered the room, the smoke smell was a bit overwhelming. Fortunately one of us came prepared and we solved that quickly. The room was pretty clean, and the beds mostly comfortable. Flat screen tv, but channels were limited and  weren't identified on the screen as the channel was changed.

Food- the Mexican restaurant had a great happy hour menu, with a great Coronarita for $8 or $10, the buffet was pretty darn good as well. On Sunday, go to the buffet early, or mid afternoon, as it was crowded and we went back twice.

As soon as we pulled up front we were greeted by Valet and he took care of us rather fast and was very friendly, he called for a bell boy who took all of our luggage. 
My girlfriend and I went to check in and there was no wait, the gentlemen who checked us in did just that but nothing further. I asked him for tips on what to do in the hotel, he didn't seem to have a good connection or experience to give me advice. I also asked what was good to eat in the hotel since we were super hungry, his suggestion seemed as he just read a Boucher and repeated what it said. 
The walk from the front desk is a good distance from the hotel, but that was okay as we were able to walk by the restaurants, and see a bit of the casino. 
Okay Yelpers, the reviews are not all good on here, and I was SUPER worried what we got into, the appearance seemed clean, but we knew it was a 50/50...
As we walked in, it was a HUGE RELIEF the room was SUPER nice, and Very Clean. No problems with smoke at all. The bed was also very comfy. 
The next morning we wanted to check out the buffet as we walked up the line was too long for me. 
We kept walking, and right next door was a little restaurant.
We got seated pretty fast, and the waitress came rather fast and offered us the specials. The food was great, and the waitress was also great.
The casino is a good size and had a lot of slot play. They do have a rewards card that gets you some advantages. We went to the desk, and there was no line and three people working. The lady we went up to seemed as we interrupted her conversation with the other ladies behind the desk. She seemed as she did not want to help us and our questions were just an interruption to her day. 
Our check out was easy, and fast. The lady who checked us out was very nice.
Over all I would highly recommend this place if you don't mind being away from the strip. I am very picky and if it was going to be sketchy or dirty to us we would have left. I was very VERY surprised on how clean and updated everything seemed to be.

36.1329483,-115.084904,2,3.0,"Never going back, Period.

Where to start...

First - VERY ghetto and sketchy location. Don't show up / check- in after dark. Like others have mentioned... there are prostitutes that meander the parking lot. We arrived around 7pm and took the last parking space in the open outside lot. The two cars we parked in between had 4 girls smoking weed in one, and two shirtless men that were reclined all the way back in the other.  *Hrmm, somethings not right here*  

If you are checking in, just pull up to the valet area and have someone stay in the car there. The check in line was painful as there was only 1 customer rep and there were 4 people ahead of us. We were getting worried since it was taking so long and due to the people/cars we parked next to. I was praying the car wasn't getting broken into while we were waiting in line. 

The front and interior area smelled old and similar to bathroom cleaner which was replaced by the overwhelming cigarette smell as we walked further into the casino area.  We parked in the parking garage which was empty - again sketchy - and then proceeded to get lost trying to find the elevators since the front person gave us the wrong directions. 

The room was clean and didn't smell like smoke but we booked 1 king and ended up with 2 queens. We didn't fuss about it but just fyi to make sure you check if you need one or the other.

The casino tables are crap. The croupiers are not as helpful as other casinos and didn't seem to care about us having fun. I did like the slots but only for the points and how they earned in comparison to other casinos. I found one that was right in front of a bar so we were able to finally get drinks but expect a long wait if you are not close by. 

The kid zone looked odd, kinda like a big Mc Donalds play land. I don't recommend it but there were parents dropping their kids off there and at the movie theater next to it. 

The food is the only reason this place gets a 2 star.  Be advised its a LONG wait unless you are going at an odd time, and the it's still a 15 minute wait. The food was great at both the buffet and the cafe. We ordered from the cafe next door and it was AWESOME food for so cheap. We were stuffed!!  And our bill with two drinks (no booze since we brought ours from the casino) was $8. 

Oh yea and they charge you fees for internet, newspapers and the pool- which are not negotiable. What ticked us off the most though- we stayed 3 nights and only got 2 newspapers - really? You charge for the newspapers and all and don't even deliver them?!  And the pool is a little dinky pool.  I rather go somewhere else that you get what you pay for. The fee doubled our room rate which we could have paid elsewhere closer to Fremont and the strip.  We will not be going back.",0.0426263362488,100,3.52,2012-03,2,0,0,0

But that was a long time ago, and it still looks almost the same (except for the iPad station to stay up to date of course). I've also watched movies here, ate at their buffet and most of their restaurants, drank at most of their bars, stayed here when my shower wasn't working, played bingo, played poker, lots of slots and tables, cashed my check, played arcades, bought a pair of nifty sunglasses at their gift shop, and I was even an extra in one of their commercials about 15-16 years ago.

The ambiance is what you'd expect of an almost 20-year old casino on the Boulder Strip. Don't expect glam, modern, or ultra-unique. I'll get to the hotel later.. The casino itself is clean and not much else can be said about their style and decor.

Throughout the years, I've been pretty happy with my experiences there. I am at the point now where I know a lot of the employees by name (which now I don't get carded anymore!) and say hi each time I visit. They are all wonderful people who make me smile and make my visits that much better. 
-There is a wide variety of dining choices for whatever mood you're in. All the bars are somewhat different from one another too depending on what kind of drinking mood you are in. 
-No shortage of gambling options either, just know your limits, people!
-The hotel rooms are nice and tidy, recently renovated, and an amazing value. I was actually pretty impressed with the way they updated them. 
-Yes, it is in a crummy area. The Boulder Strip has a lot of history and hopefully in the future, it can regain some vibrancy and sense of safety. I do often see security monitoring the area on bikes, so that helps. And now with retired sheriff Bill Young as VP of security for Station Casinos, I'm sure they'll be doing everything in their power to make sure nothing goes wrong at their properties. I haven't had any problems myself at any of my many visits.. but I am a pretty intimidating fellow.    

I do feel this place has some frustrating negatives: 
-This casino seems to be more smokey than others for some reason.
-The slots don't seem that loose here. I almost always do better on the strip where it's supposedly a lot tighter.
-Really weak arcade area for the kids.
-A lot of their promotions/drawings aren't that great, to me anyways. Which might be a good thing to keep my money in my pocket!",0.307901013715,29,3.62,2012-04,3,0,1,0

They have a small table games section where they have all the staples - Craps, Roulette, BJ, Pai Gow, and Ultimate Texas Hold 'Em.  Their dealers are much friendlier than average, which makes a difference when you're spending a significant amount of time and money at a table.  

The Buffet can be crazy crowded, but if you manage to go during off hours, it's REALLY good.  Boulder also offers KidsQuest - the childcare/playplace where you can drop your kiddos off while you get your game on.  The rates are pretty reasonable, and my boys beg to go!

I have always liked the bar there as well.  After a while we would move over to the Kixx Bar and listen to some really awful karaoke.  I like the restaurants as well.  The Broiler makes a good steak.  Guadalajara (name has changed now) had pretty decent Mexican food w/ a salsa bar.  I miss the to go Chinese food that was there next to Starbucks.  I forgot the name but they would pile up the portions and almost dare you to try and finish it.  Gambling there is what it is... the rewards card is like anywhere else, the more you play the more points you get.  I have been getting kind of bored with gambling and maybe spend $20 a week just to pass some time and to get out of my house.  Now, on to my review from today's check in:

I like how Boulder Station is freeway close which makes it easy for me to meet clients.  I sell guitars and amplifiers that I fix up and / or modify.  And, then sell them online.  So, I usually meet my customers in a public place.  Boulder Station is a good place to do that.

So, today, I was early and decided to walk around the Casino to see what, if anything has changed.  For all that I can tell, the only difference is a change in slots.  The set up has been the same for as long as I can remember.  I don't know if that is a good or bad thing.  

The negative thing that I have to say about Boulder Station is the Seediness of the area.  There's a lot of homeless hanging around asking for change.  Prostitutes approaching you and asking you if you are alone and to see if you want to pay for some herpes.  But, it is what it is and I can live with it.

Probably 2nd lowest rated of the station casinos ( I can't stand Palace Station !! ) but it's still worthy of an occasional trip.

Gaming - the aforementioned Bingo is average at best - small area for non-smokers that is of little value given the crappy ventilation.  Free drinks ain't the best - only beer options are bud and bud light.  They have a ton of gaming machines to choose from.  A large number of table games.  given my focus on craps - i like the 10x odds but not happy with the ""modified"" fire bet ( a home run gives you 300-1 on the fire .)  Also, frustrated by the fact that virtually every visit involved trainee dealers.  The drink ladies frequently make the rounds - big plus !  They have a large poker room that is very active.  Bad Beat jackpots appear to drive the level of activity.

Food - working class restaurants.  we've only tried the burger king and subway.  Surprised we haven't hit the buffet.  I suspect the buffet will be average at best but again, i've yet to try.  They have a steakhouse which the gaming hosts have offered a comp - i'm sure one day we'll try.

Bars - they have a decent number of bars but i've only had one drink at a bar.  Surprised at the quizical response when i asked for a blue moon - am i speaking greek ??

Entertainment - I have no idea !  I believe they have a movie theatre but i'm not 100% sure.

(does not include service fees of 14.99 per night) also there are taxes and such which were an additional $30 but that is common for all hotels in Las Vegas. I decided on Boulder because the room reviews were really good compared to the other hotels at the same price. 

At check in we got a value pack which included one free bingo blue pack, one free dessert from the cafe with entree purchase, free cocktail, discounts on Keno and Poker, one free bowling game- so much fun. I took advantage of most of the options- enjoyed playing bingo. Also the first night you check in get your rewards card because they add on a few dollars instants play money!

I also like that the hotel has security at the guest room entrance 24 hours. Towels I will say were a little rough- but for $25 a night I was not expecting four season towels.

The buffet: only went to the breakfast one- and it was good. At 4.99 a person you cant beat the options. Way better then Sunset breakfast. Also the buffet always has a line- thats what made me try it, they were so busy! and I am glad I did.

Overall: Boulder has everything you need and if your just looking to get away and not DEAL with the strip this is a perfect option- great place for a staycation.",0.233541666667,68,3.76,2013-03,2,0,0,0

I'd say it's about on par with the other Station Casinos (with the exception of Green Valley Ranch and Red Rock, which are both top of the line.)  A good place and area to stay in that's a much greater value than the Strip - not to mention the Boulder Highway casinos are known to pay better, for the most part.  About equal to Sam's Town and the Eastside Cannery down the road.

Rooms:

Pretty standard, and much better after the remodel a few years back.  Ask for a higher floor for really great desert and Strip views.

Restaurants:

The Feast Buffet is great at all of the Station Casinos.  Burger King, Subway, and Winchell's Donuts  are pretty much like the rest of them.  One thing I noticed on all my past visits is that these franchises don't really have inflated prices for being in a casino, like you'll usually get everywhere else, which is awesome.

Pool:

Could be a little bigger.  No atmosphere, just a rectangular outdoor pool with a wrought iron gate around it.

Casino:  huge and sprawling, kind of like most of the other Station Casinos are.  

My only reason for not giving it a five star rating is due to something I witnessed during a stay a few years back.  The elevators are manned by security guards, and showing your key is a requirement, which is usually a good thing as far as safety goes.  However, I stopped at the security guard's podium to show my room key, and go figure, he was asleep!  There were a good dozen people, a couple that might have been prostitutes, that took advantage of this and jumped on the elevator very quickly.",0.21583994709,318,4.16,2013-03,4,1,1,0

I stayed here a couple months ago for 2 nights and won't be going back because I had a bad experience at the buffet.

One morning, prior to the buffet opening we stood in line. There were two long lines each going out either side. There was a handicap sign on the side that I was standing in but nobody standing in line was handicapped, and I asked the people behind me if I was in the wrong line. They were tourists, and were just as unsure as I was.

After about 20-25 minutes in line I get to the front and the (heavy set black) lady says the line is for VIP and disabled people only. She refused to let me pay and said we had to go to the back of the other line.

We walk away to the other line and wait expecting to see the middle aged (white) couple be sent back to this line too. But surprisingly I don't see them making the same trek that I did.

Now I'm furious and I walk up and I call her out on it. I say hey, why did you send us to the back of the line but let the other couple go?

She claimed they had a disabled veterans card unaware that I had chatted with them in line, and discovered that they were tourists from Utah, and they too did not know which line to stand in.

I walked away appalled and pissed off. This was absolutely the worst experience I've ever had in Vegas. 

It's been a couple months but that experience still lingers.

I regret not going  to her manager that same morning and filing a complaint. We ended up not eating there as it was a work morning and we were now running late. We got food to go at the cafe that took a while next door and of course they forgot to add stuff to our order as well.

For the most part, good value for the price, except our last stay, which was nascar weekend and prices were very inflated.   That is to be expected, but our precious stay was 3 nights free, so quite a difference, depending on when you travel.  

Rooms - average rooms, nicely decorated.  Nothing extraordinary.  Showers are hit and miss as far as whether you get hot water for the entire shower.  That is very frustrating.  2 out of our 3 stays, we had noisy neighbors who came in to their rooms in the middle of the night and made LOTS of noise.  First time, we called security and they quieted down for about 10 minutes before the partying/yelling/cursing continued.  Other loud neighbors were not partying, but, let's just say we could hear ALL of their private time and even talking in just conversational voices.  This lack of soundproofing between rooms is annoying.  We noticed on our last stay that the housekeeping staff was very chintzy with the toiletries.  One bar of soap that we had to share between sink and shower and they didn't replace the soap until our last night there (we stayed 5 nights). 

Casino - large casino with lots of variety for slot machines.  Table gaming area was great.  I didn't have any trouble finding a $5 blackjack table any of the times that I played.  Dealers were very friendly.  Cocktail service was mostly prompt and accurate.  Only downside for me was the smoke.  Even with no one at your table smoking, the casino seems to be very smokey.  Better air flow would definitely help the atmosphere. 

Buffet - great food, especially for the price.  Lots of variety.  Only $4.99 weekdays for breakfast buffet.  

Grand Cafe - good food and great service.  Ate both breakfast and dinner here several times.  Great dinner specials and excellent food.  Also a great dessert case for the times you want to take a dessert back to upto room to enjoy later.  

Viva Salsa - good, inexpensive Mexican fast food.  Loved the fresh cilantro that they had in the garnishment area.  

Pasta Cucina - great atmosphere.  Good food and good prices. 

Pool - we haven't used the pool but on our first visit, there were hundreds of large bugs (beetles?) in the area between the casino and the pool.  Nasty!  Did not notice any bugs on subsequent visits, so hopefully that was a one time thing.

They have $.50 minimum tables for those on a budget, and $2500 max limits so you can bet high stakes if that's your game (it's mine.)

The Feast Buffet (I went from Brunch) had a lot of options, everything I had tasted amazing, they offered free champagne (for those who enjoy booze with breakfast) and the whole thing with a players club card is $9.99 per person.  

The Grand Cafe (both here at the Boulder Station, and the Palace Station) is one of my favorite places to go while in vegas.  It's open 24 hours, serves a full menu, and makes one hell of a Hot open face turkey sandwich.  

The rooms here are also fairly decent, I only use them to sleep and store my things. So I've never spent too much time in the room any of the times i've stayed here, but I will say the beds are firm, pillows are soft, and the AC goes down to 60.  TV selection isn't too great but again I spend a minute amount of time in the room so it means nothing to me.

Apparently 3 tables is too much for a waiter to accommodate an elderly lady who has trouble walking?!

Our server who finally came was a tall, light haired mid 30's man and was very short tempered with us.  You can tell that these employees do not enjoy their employment at all one bit and they are not shy to show it either.

We asked if there was any carnitas and he did not seem to understand what it was.  We did not think this place was an authentic restaurant at all.  Which was why we asked.  It was another near argument with him just asking him that question. 

The food came and it looked generic.   As if it was pulled from the buffet a few feet away and placed on a plate.  Bland poor food, nobody finished.

Firstly, I called to make an appointment at  the grooming department about 2 weeks in advance and ask that the main groomer tend to my cat because this would be his first time at the groomers. They agreed and I set up the appointment. Upon entering the grooming area the groomers were all outside smoking and no one was at the desk. I waited for about 15 minutes and then I went outside and asked to speak to someone regarding getting my cat groomed.

After they came in we discussed grooming and agreed on getting him an oatmeal bath, nail clipping, and trim. I had asked that he recieved a lion cut due to the Vegas heat. 

I was quoted an hour for the entire service so I was excited about the time due to the  fact I would be able to pick up groceries while he was being pampered. But before I left I noticed that here was some non-needed loud dryers going on in the back room (which had no animals in it). I asked that they only use the dryers when needed due to the fact that he is scared of loud noises, they ignored my request and tried to take him to the back. He of course would have none of that and they had to turn them off anyway.

When I arrived back to pick him up he was just then getting dried. Another hour later they said he was done (2 1/2 hrs so far). They put him in his carrier before I saw him so I assumed he was done as we had discussed, payed them a pretty penny for the work, and went home. When I got home and took him our of the carrier I found that half of the agreed upon services were not completed. He had no lion cut, had danrif all on his fur, and his nails had been jaggly done. Needless to say I will not use their grooming services again.

In addition to the bad grooming services, this Petco has awful customer service in store. The cashiers are rarely avaliable up front and if you have questions or need anything you have to wonder around the store for some time to find someone. I personally refrain from going to Petco and instead reccomend Petsmart.",-0.0516666666667,29,3.21,2011-08,0,0,2,0

came here yesterday to pick up my teacup yorkie puppy new toys. :))

This location is nearest to me. 

I'm a huge fan of petco's 2 for $5 toys. My puppy loves getting new toys and with petco's great deals... I can afford to pick up new toys often. I also found a steal at the markdown bin... a nylabone product for $4.

Customer service is great! Peggy one of the workers there was really nice. We talked a lot about yorkies.

I walked out with a bag of nylabone's denta bones + toys + nylabone teething bone and a happy puppy.

I'll def come back here for all of Ebi's needs.

Went in looking for a new bird cage. As I walked in, there were 4 employees standing around by the door and not one greeted me. Not one asked if I needed any help. By the time I picked out the cage I wanted (which was rather large and heavy)- not one employee offered to help as I brought it to the register. 

Once at the register, not one employee was in sight. I stood there for some time. One of the groomers saw me and continued to groom her dog. A couple more minutes passed and then she looked over at me again... and this time finally called to get an employee to the register.

Once the employee was at the register, he was actually pretty rude. But he did finally ask if I needed some help. At this point I really didn't need it since I knew I was going to be buying a large cage so I parked close. I declined the offer and then he gave a snarky remark along with a mumble under his breath.

February 2, 2011

Intended on playing Bingo.  I arrived late and ended up eating Fatburger and gambling.  

Ordered:
Skinny Fries (Well-Done)
Fat Burger (no onions and relish)

PROS:
* convenient location located inside casino near movie theaters
* clean eating area
* they got my order right!  
* Unsweetened Green Tea and Black Tea!
*Chili fries and you can add an egg to your burger!

CONS:
* Wouldn't accept my BOGO coupon. Cashier didn't know how to enter it.

TIPS:
* Skinny fries taste incredible Well Done and extra Crispy !

This place would have gotten a 4 star if my coupon was accepted.  The only reason he didn't accept it was because he didn't know how to enter into the system.  I figured call a manager and off I go, but I guess that didn't cross his mind.  It's all good.  I still have the coupon and will use it next time I go to a Fatburger.  This is your typical Fast Food burger joint.  Just a bit more pricey.  Super Good though. I recommend you try Fatburger if you haven't already done so.",0.176729024943,143,3.87,2011-01,3,1,1,1

This was before meal was prepared so I was sure it wouldn't be hard to correct... the cashier looked me right in the face and said I know that is not what you ordered but its better!

So the cashier  calls the manager over and HE tells me that he would not give me a refund that I was be happy with what I ordered. I argued that I didn't want double patty, too much food, just give me my money back ill go else where and he would not budge.

We save anywhere from 20 to 40 percent certain items. Sometimes we get a bogo free coupon and its usually unlimited so that equates to 50 percent each item!

Service is outstanding for if they ever see you just standing there looking dazed and confused, they actually approach you and make sure to lead you in the direction of the whatever it is that you are looking for. They also do a good job of keeping the entire clean and organized which is not an easy thing to do for the store itself is pretty big.

So when it comes to arts and crafts, Michaels is the first place we think of going and in most cases, we come home with just about everything we need. Good thing this location is not too far from us for that is another convenience that we are thankful for.

The customer rep said fixing the tire was free but did up-sell me the rotation and balancing for the ""special price of $25!"".  I ended up accepting anyway since it had been a while since I've done that and the customer service was great enough that I didn't mind.

After some online research, I had a certain tire in mind that I wanted to get as I need all four tires replaced. I went to this location on Craig based on the good reviews.
 
I told the man who was helping me (he was super nice by the way) that I wanted a certain tire. He checked it out and they were out of the tire I wanted. So he recommended I get a different tire instead of waiting for the ones I picked out, because this other tire was better quality plus it was currently on sale.

Naturally, I thought he was trying to take advantage of me and make some extra cash by selling me this ""other"" tire... so I took a time-out and looked up tire reviews from my phone. Turns out I was just being a paranoid freak because he was being completely honest. The tire he recommended was actually MUCH better than the one I had picked out (I just didn't consider it because it was out of my price range online). In the store however, it ended up being only a couple dollars more than the tire I originally picked out because it was on sale. 
So I came out winning thanks to the super nice, honest Discount Tire guy! Yay!

Long story short-- this was the first time in my life that I was actually wrong about getting ripped off at a car-place. I've had my new tires for a few weeks now and I LOVE them. I can tell just by how my car rides that they're much better quality.

I needed new tires all the way around. I was helped this visit right away. The total for all 4 tires with warranty was $733. That is a lot of moola! I was shocked! After checking around though it seemed this was the best deal I was going to get. I was told it would be 30 minutes.

On the phone, the manager said my 4 Michelin tires would be at the store in one hour, and I would be out the door in 30 minutes.  I would receive a $100 rebate to boot.

I arrived at the business in 1 hour and 15 minutes; all new tires were already there; and, despite about 10 people already in the waiting room, all tires were quickly mounted on my car and I was out the door in 29 minutes, with the $100 rebate processed online by me without any glitches within an hour after that.  So why the loss of half a star?

I was asked by the manager if I had picked up a complimentary bottle of cold water, and I responded that I had helped myself to a free bottle, but it was not cold.  Although several salesmen were moving about, no one had apparently noticed that the refrigerator was totally empty; only warm bottles rested in cases on top.  As I was leaving, I saw an employee start to restock the refrigerator with water bottles.

More importantly, when my car was returned to me I noticed that visible white lines (probably from sealant) had streaked all four tires.  It took me less than 5 minutes to wash all the streaks off with water at a nearby gas station.  But it should be obvious to the service techs that when a car owner spends several hundred dollars to buy new mounted tires, he or she would like to see them looking better upon receipt than the old worn ones that were just removed.  I feel that the technicians should spend a few extra minutes making sure that the tires are properly detailed before presenting a car for return--even if that might throw off the 30-minute promise a bit.  Speed is much less important than mounting and tightening the tires properly and presenting a nice-looking final product.  

I know these particular tires were all properly mounted and tightened because I just arrived intact in southern California without incident after driving at high speeds from North Las Vegas in the middle of the night (to beat the heat) following an enjoyable UYE at Settebello's in Henderson.

I quickly declined his offer because I thought he was just trying to make a sale and I left. After doing some research and speaking with other wheel and tire technicians they all agreed that the tire was too worn to be fixed. I found a small tire shop to plug the hole and I went on my way.

It's not the instructors, they are amazing.  However, the management in these studios seems more intent on greedily making money than actually providing a quality yoga experience for their communities.  
I wrote this studio off awhile ago, but then last year decided to give them a second chance & join a friend for a ""community"" class which was supposed to be $10.  When I went to pay with a credit card, they informed me I would have to pay $17 if I was not going to pay with cash.  So you want to penalize me for not paying in cash?  Um, a bit ridiculous don't you think?  After driving all the way to the other side of town, I paid it & enjoyed my class.  But I thought I'd never return.  
Then this year, Groupon had an 8 class pckg available for a significant reduction in price.  One of my favorite instructors teaches there right now & so I decided to give the ""Sanctuary"" a third try.  I was not informed that I only had 30 days from redeeming the groupon with the first class to use all 8 classes, I was under the impression I had until the Groupon expiration date.  So when I showed up for my third class I was told my Groupon had already expired.  They were completely unwilling to work with me.  So I left, drove down the street to Bodyheat Yoga & Pilates (an amazing studio btw) & paid even more than $17 for one of their classes.  For a studio like Yoga Sanctuary to charge what they do when they do not provide adequate space for changing, showering, etc... is ridiculous.  
Also, if you work at night, you don't have much choice of day classes, they have a limited number available, & nothing in the afternoons on any day except Saturday.

I've done yoga in the past, but a much more watered-down, stretchy-type yoga.  Most of the classes here are vinyasa or vinyasa-based, which makes for a pretty good workout.  Especially if you try a hot vinyasa class on Mondays/Tuesdays or Zeek's Baptiste, a 90-minute hot yoga class with many principles of vinyasa.

Every teacher here that I have had the chance to have class with is wonderful.  My favorites are Willow and Zeek but they all have something unique to bring to each class and will all provide you a phenomenal experience.

My favorite class is Christine's aromatherapy yoga on Wednesdays - by this point in my work week, I absolutely NEED this class.  It is so very relaxing with the all-natural oils and I can almost do a headstand now!  Woo!

If you want a workout, try Willow's Happy Hour Vinyasa Groove on Fridays at 6 and Zeek's Baptiste on Saturdays at 10.  They will get you sweating and flowing and while you may feel like you're going to die you won't (I promise, I'm still here) and at the end it is so, so worth it.

Once my Groupon ran out, I looked over the schedule and noticed most of my favorite classes were $10 cash (there's a star by them on the schedule), which is wonderful!  Sign in, give 'em my cash, and I pop a yogi squat.  This is definitely the best deal unless you go to more than 8 classes a month and know you'll be committed to it for a year - you can do a $79/month unlimited classes at this studio location only, but you have to pay first and last months up front.

Then I went to Fado, and I had a few delicious items that weren't boiled yet were delicious.  I can't attest to the authenticity of the fare, but when my taste buds are Michael Flatley-ing all over my tongue, I couldn't really care less about authenticity.

Things that are awesome:

* Their fish and chips are great, second only to the Crown and Anchor.  It's also what half of everyone in the restaurant has, and I hope it's not because they're afraid of black pudding.

* The All Day Irish Breakfast.  Eggs, Irish sausages, rashers, black & white pudding, baked beans and tomatoes.  This thing is HUGE, and it's delicious.

* Blackened Chicken and Shrimp Boxty.  This is by far my favorite.  A generous portion of blackened chicken and shrimp with tomatoes and mushrooms in a creamy white cheese sauce, all wrapped up in a potato boxty (a thin, crepe-like pastry with a wonderful texture).

* Black and Tan Brownie with Guinness Ice Cream.  Yeah, it's a variation of the same chocolate brownie/cake with ice cream and fudge that every restaurant has which is always called the Vesuvius or the Chocolate Thunder Mountain or another such mountainous moniker.  But this is a BLACK AND TAN brownie with GUINNESS ice cream and, let me tell you, you can tell.  It's so stinkin' tasty.

They have trivia some nights and entertainment others (check the site).

Unfortunately, like many things in Las Vegas, it is tucked away in the corner of an obscenely large casino.  The casino in question is WAY off the strip.  The pub is up on the second or third floor and way off in the corner.    Our search for this place felt like an episode of  Lord of the Rings:  Following signs, backtracking, splitting up and meeting again, etc.  We had a great advantage over the hobbits in that we had our cell phones to keep in touch.  Furthermore, we could stop and rest along the way with booze, food, and of course craps.  Those poor little hobbits...

Our 8 person party was escorted to a table through a labyrinth of small rooms/anterooms and seated for dinner.  We drank like fish, ate lots of fish and chips, and enjoyed the band.  It was for the most part a great bar band, the kind you often see in Vegas if you're just walking around.  It was a little jarring to have to leave the nice dark wood and dim lighting of the pub to go out into the casino and find the restroom, but we all survived.  
Unless you're already out in Green Valley for some reason, I can't imagine any great reason to hit this place.  However if you are already in the building, it's a decent place to drink.

The original Fado's has moved from Green Valley Ranch and opened up shop on the busy streets of Eastern Avenue.  It ended up being quite an intimate event with Tiger W. and Sean S.  Our hostess for the evening brought over a round of drinks on the house including some appetizers to try.  

* Dublin's Sampler Platter ""This favorite combines full orders of our Cheese Dip, Chicken Tenders and Chicken Boxty Quesadillas."" $19.95 

* Cheese Dip and Wedges ""A creamy blend of three cheeses served with boxty wedges for dipping."" $6.95 - What makes this appetizer unique is their wedges.  Tasty things and who doesn't love cheese for dipping?

* Chicken Tenders ""Chicken tenders in crisp tempura with a side of our own honey mustard."" $7.95 - It really is the tempura batter that makes these tenders pretty delicious!  The Big F really enjoyed these treats!

* Chicken Boxty Quesadillas ""Our signature boxty potato pancake is richly layered with grilled chicken, melted pepper jack cheese and drizzled with a red chili aioli.  Tomato pico and sour cream on the side."" $9.95 - Quesadillas that are yummy with the potato pancake mix.  Good stuff.

And if you don't know what a boxty is, ""Associated with rural sections of Ireland, the traditional Boxty is a gently seasoned potato pancake filled with special ingredients and cooked on a griddle.""

With it being a Thursday, it's Trivia Night!  This turned out to be quite a fun event, despite us having to bail early.  Gift certificate prizes are up for grabs and you can work in teams.  Although the games reminded me of weakness with trivia, I had a pretty good time with good company in hand.

Additional appetizers we got to try included:

* Corned Beef Rolls ""Tender corned beef and creamy mustard sauce tightly rolled inside a traditional boxty topped with a cabbage salad."" $6.75 - Corned beef and cabbage put together into the perfect bite size portions.  They do this really well!

* Smoked Salmon Bites ""Traditional cold-smoked, oak salmon on crisp boxty ""blini"" with capers, onions and a light horseradish sauce."" $8.95 - Another bite-size treat that is pretty good stuff.

Overall, Fado's is a pretty big pub with an upstairs area too.  A relaxed atmosphere with an interesting mix of people.  My only complaint was that a waitress forgot to bring a menu at one point, and then forgot a drink later on.  No big deal really since there's a bunch of people there.

It's not something that the management can change unless they want to close the place down, have a smoky peat bonfire inside for about a month, then bring in every chain smoker in Las Vegas for an additional month, send the help around to ding edges and rub things with century-old grime and generally batter the place up.  Yeah, I know, not all pubs are battered, but there is a distinct feel of age and wear in even the cleanest of them.  The service was okay--the waitress had a few too many tables to handle well, and that's not her fault.  The food was decent as well--I had bangers and mash.  Unfortunately, it wasn't as authentic as I would have liked.  The bangers were dead on--with thin, crisp skins and nice fatty pork inside.  The mash was made from real potatoes, not instant potatoes, but the cabbage was some bright green stuff (or was that parsley?).  The gravy had a very red-wine flavor--lovely, but not traditional.  And the peas?  The frozen green things, not proper marrowfat peas.  It was the sort of interpretation that will and should appeal to Americans who haven't gone to English schools in the UK.

My friends have really enjoyed Fado for lunch in the past and so I thought I would give it a try for St. Paddy's.  Probably a mistake going to a very busy Irish pub on St. Patrick's Day but I thought it would be fun to check out the live music under the tent and reasonably priced Killian's Irish Red.  It wasn't the immense crowd that make me unhappy, but the fact that on a day when Fado knows they are going to be turning a huge profit, they still charged a $15 cover charge just to get in and wait in line for 20 minutes for a cup of beer.  In principle I usually refuse to pay a cover charge but my friends and I had already made plans to meet another friend there and so we felt obligated to stay.  Plus, the doorman said that I would be receiving a $10 gift card for entering, really only making my cover charge $5.  Too bad he didn't mention that you had to spend $20 on items other than alcohol in order to get the $10 discount.  That's not called a gift certificate, that is a coupon.  By the time my other friend arrived only 30 minutes after I did, the line was so long (around the block!) that she would have to wait at least an hour to enter, so all of us ended up leaving and going to another restaurant/bar.  $15 per head cover when you already know you are going to turn a huge profit is just greedy.  On a positive note, there was no line for the ladies room inside of the bar due to the crowd control at the door. Perhaps contributing to my negative attitude is the fact that I am possibly just getting too old for this kind of experience, with the meat-market atmosphere and drunk idiots everywhere.

One concern I always have is the front staff. To me they are the first people you encounter when going to a doctor for the first time. JMO those at the front desk should be welcoming. You do not know how people are feeling when going to see a doctor. Empathy is truly one of the keys to health care and customer service in general. Is it that hard to even just say hello. How are you today? Make the patient feel like they are going to be treated with respect. When you are just handed a clip board, not even a pen?? Well then I say I am nothing more than a dollar in someone's pocket. I sat there thinking will I get great care from the doctor? I was unsure.   
Then I met the assistant to the doctor. That was one of the most unpleasant experiences I have ever had. She could not even crack a smile. I could tell she could not wait to get out of the room. And I could not wait for her to leave. At this point I was ready to call it a day and go to quick care. But I came this far. I had to give the doctor a chance. My mom loved him? 
The doctor came in a few minutes later. He was friendly. He asked questions. He did the exam. He was thorough. I did find him a little condescending as I cannot pronounce a medical diagnosis. He made sure to correct me and not in a nice way. 
He advised me as to what to do. 
He told me if I need to come back for  additional treatment to do so. 
Will I? Not sure. Do I think he is a good doctor yes I do.

The nurses and office staff are an average of 3.  Some are really friendly and others look/act like they wish they were elsewhere.  Since they are working with kids, I just expect them to be more approachable and warmhearted.  

Like all doctor offices, you spend a lot of time waiting in the waiting room regardless of your appointment time.  But, at least this office has a partition between the healthy and sick waiting rooms with separate entrances.  I also like the fact that there aren't toys in this room because who knows how often those are sanitized.  So I recommend bringing your own if you need to keep your child occupied.  But, there is a TV in the waiting room programmed on a kid friendly channel, and who can resist an episode of Dora the Explorer.

I was supposed to meet a friend here for their ""Underground Screening Room"" event tonight.  Said friend had to cancel out just as I pulled into the parking lot, but I stayed to see what this show was all about.

Five dollars for this show is a bargain.  It's a tiny comics shop in the front, but it's a weird selection of comics.  Not the most realized collection I've seen, but they had quirky, unusual stuff here that caught my eye, and will force me to make a return.

As I walked to the back, I bought my ticket for the show.  I didn't know what to expect, but they offered popcorn and sodas upfront.  Okay, that was a little cool and a nice touch.

The show itself?  It was very neat.  This little Bohemian group of almost Vaudeville performers doing magic, dance, burlesque, comedy, and more magic.  It all felt very fresh and just different, like this little secret hole in the wall filled with cool and awesome things.

Apparently, these shows are once a month, so I will have to go again.  They also do classic cult sci-fi screenings.  I just missed a vintage Doctor Who marathon (curses), so I decided to add them to my Facebook to keep an eye on their ""Coming Events"" schedule.

What a weird, wonderful little thing to stumble upon.  I like quirk, and this place was full of it.  It's nice to see people put so much of their heart into just entertaining the crowd.  It all felt very personal, and the performers seemed to be into mingling with the audience during and after the show.

Located in the eclectic and low rent Commercial Center (large strip mall on the 900 block of East Sahara), Sci Fi Center is run on the cheap.  But they've done a lot with a little.  They converted the spacious back room of a comic book shop into a small theater, complete with old theater chairs.  And in the evenings on weekend days, they sell cheap tickets ($5 when I went) to watch classic science fiction television shows and movies, as well as the best and worst horror films ever made.

In the office you'll find seating and advertisements for kinky places, shops, and vacations. Pretty awesome, I took a handful.

Once inside, you'll see a kink store that specializes in their own brand of ""electro-stimulus play"". Basically you buy the box and wiring. Then buy the accessories. There are more accessories than you can shake a stick at. I mean a whole catalog, and illustrations of how they can each be used.

Entering through the screening room is perfect. I have been shopping with looky-loos milling about and have little patience for people who seem offended that my companions and I can openly discuss what we're considering and why. Seriously folks, it's a FETISH, ADULT, SEX-related store. The Studio understands this! That's not to say there aren't gawkers on occasion, but this certainly lessens the probability. 

Why is this important? For me, the entry makes it that much more personal. You aren't wandering in off the street and picking at plastic bachelor party toys to shock your friends while some random clerk shouts out a half-hearted hello. You are entering a space into which you are invited, guided. This was a new one for me, and stepping over that threshold in that manner made all the difference.

My guide was Anna. I was given a quick tour with some information to help me get the lay of the land, and then left to browse. I wasn't hassled or hustled; she doesn't hover, but she is there in a flash if you need assistance. Knowledge is a powerful tool, especially shopping for the types of items I was browsing. This isn't just a job for her and it shows. She helped me understand various materials, shapes and care of things as I made my choices and even asked questions to make sure she could help me find just the right items. No one else in town (anywhere?) has ever taken the kind of time to understand what I needed and what would be the, ahem, best fit.
 
Not just the toys, but the clothes are fantastic. I fell in love with a black latex corset that shined with many heavy, steel, buckles. I had to have it! Anna took the time to show me what it was that I was trying on, showed me the construction, compared it to other items to ensure this was exactly what I wanted, and then the darling helped me into it!

I tried on a few things, never feeling that I was wasting her time as I hemmed and hawed a bit as I made my decisions.

Leather, latex, vinyl, toys... you name it, they've got it! (Minus the kitschy ""shock"" party favors and clueless clerks.) Whether new to any of their wares or a member of the old guard, they've got you covered.

I was looking around, asking questions, and found myself pleasantly surprised at the depth and breadth of knowledge that was being shared with me.

Then I understood it... They make it all themselves! It's easy to hop online and find a kit on other shopping sites and such, but here, I can buy directly from the manufacturer. PES makes, markets, and sells all their own stuff! 

They aren't cheap, ""small"" kits can easily cost $500 or more. PES is no exception - this isn't a missive to declare bargain basement prices. The point is that electrical toys are intricate, delicate, and given their uses, can be dangerous in the wrong hands. The money and the care involved are huge factors here, and the fact that PES makes them, sells them, supports them, offers education, community forums (awesome involvement!), etc. is what makes them so special.

The Artisan isn't bad. We went on a First Friday, the night when all the arty nightcrawlers come out.  There was a generous-sized crowd there, making it rather difficult to get a drink. Luckily we knew a cocktail wench that works there and got a comped round (even though she totally burned one of our buddies and totally stole all his shit ... but that's a different review, different day). This was the first time I've ever been and I've heard friends say they've been when they were just about the only party there. 

Valet is a requirement. Unless you want to park in the lot of the adjacent with the ""Will tow at owner's expense"" signs all over the place. 

This place is like Narnia: kind of hard to find. Come from the west side of Sahara and turn right onto Highland. Otherwise, I don't know what to say. 

The decor is pretty garish. They have all of these prints of Da Vinci's, Degas', Renoirs, whatever all done up in these guilded frames. Which isn't a bad thing, if it weren't for the fact that the walls were densly packed with these things. 

They did some innovative things with decor, it wasn't all that bad. 

The DJ was on fire, though. He was the big redeeming point about the place. 

The place isn't suitable for large parties ... as there was like eight of us. 

As shwag as it was, I thought it was odd that they had ESPN on the monitors. 

I will give the Artisan credit for being different from the rest of Vegas. Even though it is kind of the dark side of Roccoco. 

In all fairness I haven't checked out the rest of the hotel, so I couldn't give a thourough review. All we saw was the lounge and the men's bathrooms for a hot minute while we banged in the stalls. jk. It was more like two hot minutes.",0.06953125,199,3.41,2007-05,26,1,1,2

1.  It's not on the Strip.  For most that would be a con, but look at it this way:  you come to Vegas to play on the Strip all day, it's exhausting and overwhelming by the time you're done.  Why not sleep somewhere where there isn't any neon outside your window?

2.  It's close to the Strip.  So you can still do all those ""Vegas"" things you want to do.

3.  The decor is AWESOME!  Every room is themed after a different artist and all throughout the bar and lounge areas there are reproductions of famous artwork EVERYWHERE.  Even the ceilings!  It's funky, different and very well put together.

4.  There is NO GAMING.

the beds -- so comfy
the pool -- small, but clean and well-decorated. cozy seating
the room service -- prompt, courteous, and well-priced
the wedding chapel -- stark religious feel due to paintings from Renaissance era. not our kind of place to get married, but it was beautiful
the wine tastings -- every day at 5pm; free!

food in the restaurant was well-priced
the strip clubs within walking distance
free apples at the front desk

the claustrophobic feel of the rooms due to too many paintings in each room (ours had 5 when it could have gotten away with 2) and dark paint on the walls
no coffee makers in the rooms
having to wait a long time for taxis to arrive, even if we asked the front desk to have one waiting for us by a certain time

Valet only might work for some people but I like to be able to park my own car sometimes. I don't like people all up in my shit. That's the first of the small annoyances that made up my experience with The Artisan. 

The outside looks very different from the inside, inside is this old Hollywood Gothic type decor that is a stark contrast to the white, Las Vegas chapel design theme outside. 

I was here for a friend's birthday party. I was told she had planned the event with The Artisan, they knew she would be having at least 60 people in her party only. Plus all the other people who regularly would be getting wasted at 10 o'clock on a Tuesday. They had one bartender, and one bar back. What kind of shit is that? You call ahead to plan an event and you only get ONE bartender. The bar back was heard screaming she couldn't mix a drink because ""that would get confusing."" After about 30 minutes standing around when we wanted to get drunk we threw up our hands, the bartender also had taken our order and just made other peoples drink while we sat around watching and waiting. This was enormously annoying. Not one person outta our entire party could get a drink. The birthday girl couldn't even get a drink. They didn't have grey goose or don Julio tequila.

Eff that, we paid our tab and bounced. Artisan I wanted to really like you after hearing you are a local Vegas hangout and had house dj's that play every Thursday. 

After this insane night here, I won't be recommending anyone to go here though. Big thumb's down.",-0.0633986928105,65,3.91,2008-05,21,1,2,0

This place was amazing. It really is like staying at the ""Haunted Mansion"" from Disneyland, it's very dark, dark wood, dark colors, no lights, just candle's, even the elevator had a red light. Unfortunately they have mandatory valet parking of $11 dollars a day and they don't have any bell boys, so we had to drag our over packed luggage into the hotel..but with only 65 rooms, how many bell boys do you need? The check in process was easy and I requested an odd number, because since this hotel is literally off the 15 fwy you ""supposedly"" hear the traffic noise and the odd number room keep you towards the side of the hotel that doesn't face the freeway. We where in room 511, which was good since we where on the top floor and our room was just right to the elevator exit...The room was very dark, mirrors in the entire room and was themed after artist William Frieseke. We reserved a standard king room and only payed $100 for Saturday-Monday ( valentine's weekend). We could tell it wasn't the best room with chips on the banner of the bed and furniture but it was all very clean and had a nice plasma screen TV, I heard there was porn( but it must have been removed). The bathroom was clean with a nice supply of towels and soaps and shampoo and had a rainfall shower head with wonderful pressure, but no blow dryer? WTF? luckily I brought my own, another WTF was if you wanted ice you had to go to the 3rd floor to request or go to the lounge and they don't supply cups in the room, they did however have a fridge, a safe, iron and board, and they use energy efficient lighting. I'm glad we weren't there during summer time, since it did take awhile for the room to cool off. The bed was very comfy, even thou it wasn't used for more then 4 hours of sleep per day.

This is not the kind of pool party on the strip with ridiculous long lines, expensive entry charge, meat heads, bikini platforms with foolish makeup and thousands of dollars spent on cabanas or day beds.

Lounge Inn is every Sunday with no entry fee starting at 3pm continues until 10 pm and for loungers that aren't ready to go home yet, special Lounge Inn room rates are available for $40 per night. Bottle specials start at $150 with a day bed or cabana, food from the Artisan's restaurant can be ordered poolside, while watching your favorite sports on a LCD screen and listening to beats.  The food is amazing! I recommend the spinach salad with strawberries and pecans, burger and fries and the flat bread pizza Margherita!

Sunday's Lounge Inn atmosphere is intimate.  There are amazing locals with positive vibe who musically appreciates deep house, disco, afro beats, reggae, soul and mid tempo funk. It is the music that brings the people together at this party and when they do, it's all about peace, love, happiness and lots of smiles on the dance floor!

In addition, Lounge Inn is a themed event.  My attendances have been the All White Party, Parasol Sun Umbrella Twist, Beach Ball Birthday Bash and what's next? Be sure to get on Keith Evan's email list to find out for future Lounge Inn themed events and guest DJ's!

Yes, that's right. We all came to this hotel for our friend's wedding.

The Artisan put them in a regular room.

First of all - parking is valet only, so plan ahead and leave yourself $3-$5 for the guy at the end of the night.

Walking into the hotel is simply incredible. They have done an amazing job of decorating the place! While it IS dark inside, there is ample light to enjoy the various painting and mirrors on the walls and ceiling. There are quite a number of beautiful sculptures and vases throughout too.

There isn't a cover to get into the Afterhours party. Just show your ID and you're walking into a thumping techno party with some excellent house beats. The DJs are a lot of fun and the crowd there is very chill with a great appreciation for this type of music.

The alcohol flows generously and the costs are pretty reasonable. I don't remember specific prices, but I haven't ever felt like I was being ripped off.

While the dance floor area is a little small, it's still a lot of fun to groove with the electro beats as the DJ moves the crowd. Even better still is when you're hot and sweaty and want to relax, there are a number of VERY comfortable chairs, couches and love seats to relax on.

Fine leather furniture doesn't seem to match with the house/club music scene, but it really works well at the Artisan. For a little fresh air, try heading out to the patio too.

As far as off-the-strip Afterhours electronic music parties go, this one is as good as it gets.",0.321091954023,17,4.06,2010-03,0,0,2,1

My friend had her wedding there and reserved a block of rooms there for her wedding and when I called to book, they had no record of it.  When we got there, our first room had a door that was busted and wouldn't stay shut.  They moved us to a second room with a door that wouldn't open.  Then they moved us to a third room, where none of the key cards worked.  It took us four moves before we had a room with a functioning door.  When we complained, they said that the manager would call us within 20 minutes.  Didn't hear from him.  When we told the front desk a couple of hours later, they said he was very busy and would call us back.  He never did.  

The bathroom floor was so dirty that the bottoms of our feet were covered in black.  Something in the room smelled, I couldn't tell if it was the sheets or the floor.  Yuck!  With so many nice hotels in Vegas, there is absolutely no reason to stay here if you can avoid it.

I checked in as soon as I could, which was around 3PM.  I needed a room with two beds, and they wouldn't let me reserve a room with two beds; they said it was first come, first serve!

The room was very good for the price ($89.)  It was clean and was decorated in a very baroque style.  The room and bathroom were small and my window had a terrible view (the hotel's location is not the best.)  I stayed in the Gauguin room.

There were a few minor cosmetic details that could have been attended to, but since I was staying less than 24 hours, it just really wasn't important to me.

It is important to note that this is a hotel with a loud, active nightlife.  Well, it has an loud, active afternoon life, too.

We decided to have dinner at Mood last minute (after trying to go to Wayne's sushi, which was closed for private party. Blargh). Anyway, arrived around 8:30pm on Sat night sans reservations and were seated immediately. There were a few other groups having dinner and a piano player providing some ""mood"" music (yeah, i know, terrible pun...couldn't resist). The manager came over to us right away and gave us a wine list and said the server would be there in a minute with menus and to take our drink order. He was very helpful and asked what kind of wines we preferred and said he might be able to suggest something off the list. Now, at that point I wasn't really sure if I was even going have to wine and felt a little uncomfortable when he started asking our price range, but I know he was just trying to be helpful. To his credit, he brought out a bottle of red and poured some for us to try and the bf and I both liked his choice. He asked if we wanted a bottle or just 2 glasses and we said just the glasses and he poured practically a half bottle of wine into 2 glasses. I always feel sort of pressured in those situations and I hate to ask how much it is, so I just hoped when we got the bill it wasn't going to be $30 a glass or something (turned out to be $15/glass for a generous pour so I was fine with it). 

As for the food, the first thing we got was the bread basket containing lavash, garlic infused sourdough (um, hello delicious warm garlicky goodness) and another type with raisins and walnuts I think--didn't try that one. We shared the Mediterranean plate to start, which had hummus, tzatziki and an eggplant dip with pita crackers. I'm a sucker for any kind of appetizer containing a trio of dips and this didn't disappoint. It was a generous portion, nicely plated and tasty. For our mains, the bf got the pork loin special and I got the swordfish. The pork dish was ridiculously huge--the bf took one of the 2 giant slabs of pork home--and came with mashed potatoes and veggies. I had a bite of the bf's pork and it was flavorful and moist, but perhaps was brined a touch too long because it was a tad on the salty side for my tastes. However, it was still good.  My swordfish was perfectly cooked and seasoned, but I do wish it had a bit more of the mango chutney with it. There was just a small spoonful of it on top. The fish came with jasmine rice and  veggies. The rice was surprisingly good (I'm not a big rice person) and I'm not really sure what was in it. It was almost like fried rice and I could swear a saw some egg in it, but I don't recall seeing that on the menu. Regardless, it was freaking yummy. The veggies were fresh and simply prepared--baby carrots, asparagus, squash. 

Our server was super on top of things. My water glass was never empty, and that makes me happy. The prices are super reasonable--all of the entrees are in the low $20 range and the appetizers are mostly $10 or under if I remember correctly.

Now we get there at first scared to go in because it looked like a MOTEL 8 from the outside. But we gave it a shot anyways. We walked in and it looked really cool at first so were like this is better then we thought. We made friends fast with Jen the girl working up front and soon checked out there rooms.

Instead of getting a room change we decided to shell out the extra cash and get the Michael Angelo Suit. Honestly it was tacky and looked and smelled like a place a pimp would bring his hoes for a Orgy. But whatever we decided to make the best of it.

And then i saw my bill they didnt take it off i called back later they said oh yeah we were supposed to take it off but there manager reversed it and that if i want to pay half they decided i should have my cousin pay half of it which i was not going to do..There a bunch of let downs.

36.143437,-115.169098,4,3.5,"This review is for the Artisan Lounge only:

The Artisan is a cool, quirky  ""lounge"" where the decor sells the place.  It's dark, it's lush, and floor to ceiling covered with art reprints (or mirrors, in the case of the ceiling).  Most newbies to the Artisan probably get lost on the approach.  It's in the armpit of Sahara and the 15 (on the SE corner) and takes a couple of sharp right turns to actually get into the place.  Upon first arrival it appears that valet (free) is the only parking option, but if you drive past the ""driveway"" there is a parking lot down and on the right.

When you walk into the hotel you notice dark, rich colors and the walls are covered with reprints of famous art.  There are cushy chairs arranged around book nooks, which I take advantage of for a refuge from the noise of the club.  I think the loudness of the music is my only real complaint - I think over the last four years that I've been visiting the DJ's have become more mainstream (not necessarily a good thing in my opinion) and the music has become louder - to the point where you have to yell to your friends.

That said, I still go occasionally for the decor and people watching.  The lounge mimics the hotel lobby where there are art prints blanketing the walls and skirt onto the ceiling which they share with framed mirrors.  Friday and Saturdays they have a DJ that plays dance hits mixed with electronica.  If you hit the club early enough you can partake in the couches around the periphery of the club, and I advise checking out their little grotto area, especially if you have a small group.  Drinks ain't cheap, but they're no strip prices either (~$8 for a mixed drink).  I think it's a happy medium for what the place offers.

If you want a break from the strip, but the feel of a club with a more creative and interesting decor, this is the place.  To just enjoy the atmosphere and actually be able to chat with your buddies, avoid Friday and Saturday nights.  I think every Vegas local should check it out at least once, and it's a great example for out-of-town friends to see that Vegas can be more interesting and unique than what is offered on the strip.  I can see this place existing in a town like Portland or Seattle.

I guess its a good thing that more and more people have been turned on to it, however I prefer it during the week when it's a bit more relaxed and you can find a lounge chair and enjoy a glass of wine or fun drink concoction ( they have quite an assortment of interesting absinthe cocktails).

It is a dark artsy hotel. I guess I should have expected it since it is called the Artisan. I really was blown away by how much art there was! It was almost over crowded, but at the same time, it is fantastic for those who love classical art.

They had a bottle of wine in the room. They also have some sort of wine tasting I think I remember reading briefly, but I wasn't there at the time it was offered (I was out with my friends.) A lot of my friends are artsy and I wholly recommended this place since it fully suits their taste.

As for me- I am into that scene, but I am more city than that, so to me, it was simply too dark. They have this little bar area where you can get some food and drink, but to me, it's kinda creepy. Then again, I was alone, so it is not nearly as fun since it wasn't very busy.

I did take my time wandering in the place and checking out all of the art. It was worth it for sure since you'll be hard pressed to find such a thing anywhere else.

In all, I think this is more of a place for you to take your artsy friends to and have a blast. For those who just don't do the art thing, you'll probably feel more at home elsewhere. Nice stay though.",0.183364197531,33,3.73,2010-12,0,0,0,0

My terrible experience however, relates to their service as a hotel rather than as a nightclub.  It would definitely seem that they are less focused on the former than latter.  (My wife and I are in our 20's, and pretty open-minded to any experience.  We're also Vegas locals, and have stayed at several places up and down the Strip, if that makes any difference.)

We checked into our room in the around 5pm, and the room was adequate.  Cozy with very cool decor, but nothing fantastic.  We left the place to eat dinner and see a show elsewhere, and when we came back around midnight, the party was in full-swing.  We had to show our room keys just to bypass the nightclub line that had formed in front of the hotel... no big deal.

We went to the bar, had a couple drinks, a smoke, and decided to turn in... apparently this was our mistake.

Around 5am, we were awoken to a party in our 5th floor hallway.  This is beyond the control of the hotel if no one reports, so I called the front desk.

A really uninterested guy answered the phone to take my complaint.  He promised to send security up to check it out. 

Meanwhile, the party gets louder, they begin smoking in the hallway which comes right under the door and right through the vents into the room, and they are calling their friends in the club downstairs to join them at the top of the 5th floor elevator.  

I wait 10 minutes for this all to be handled by security... nothing.  I call downstairs again and am told that security would be up shortly.  10 more minutes and no change.

I call a 3rd time, and am told by the same guy that they've been sent and he offers to move me to another room.  Now, I appreciate the concession, but the offer is somewhat insulting... my wife and i are going to pack up our entire room, change out of our pajamas, walk through the party in the hallway, and settle into a new room at at 5am?  No thanks.  

So I open the door to find security ... who has finally arrived, but instead of breaking up the party, they only ask them to take it to their room, where they proceed to pump techno music ad nauseum so that entire hallway sounds like a rave.

There was no sleep to be had.  Being locals, we did decide to pack up all of our things and change into our regular clothes, but we just walked out and went home.  Night ruined.  Thanks Artisan.",0.0507049589976,4,2.0,2010-01,0,0,3,1

I have stayed in the rooms, dined here in the past and all I can say about it now is G-H-E-T-T-O. Not to be confused with ghetto fabulous either. 

The two stars is for the actual building and lighting and beautiful Gothic, eclectic decor and artwork making Artisan unique to others. The djs get a huge fist pound as well for spinning sick beats and being the only cool people left in the building. Now on to the huge three throbbing stars they will never see again. 

On my last visit it was a gorgeous night out and they had opened the patio. I venture out there thinking it would be a chic, chill place to listen to good music and have cocktails with friends. NOT. They were playing Justin Bieber through the sound system! Ugh. This is not Chuck E Cheese, people!!!! Secondly, if there was a waitress outside she was no where to be seen and I waited for over 30 minutes. Now to touch on the service. The Artisan use to have the most beautiful bartenders and cocktail waitresses in town. All with smiling faces and quick drinks just as you ordered them. The past two visits I made were for the after hours and I must say the waitresses all looked odd to me and not in a good way. One female looked sickly thin in her corset that appeared four sizes too large for her. The hair and makeup were not put together at all and she seemed on the verge of tears, too. The other looked completely TRASHED drunk and was slurring when getting our drink orders. When she stumbled back to bring our drinks they were all wrong times two rounds. Ugh. I don't know if she was bloated from all the alcohol she had been drinking, but her corset was ripping on the seams a bit! At least her blonde hair was ""did"" and she had glittery rave makeup on. I felt the service looked unprofessional and was unprofessional and both waitresses need interventions ASAP. 

This use to be the classy after hours all of the dancers from the shows and trendy locals would go to hide from the big clubs and enjoy drinks and friends in an upscale lounge. Now it appears like trash to me. If the staff is allowed to drink or not they should still be able to take drink orders and look professional.

I guarantee if you stay here you'll definitely want to come right back out. The elevators are spooky, and so were both of the rooms we saw.

The room we ended up staying in wasn't a whole lot better. the bathroom was disgusting (there was urine on the floor) the toilet barely worked, and the faucet handle kept coming off whenever you tried to wash your hands. Our room was right on the freeway side, so I guess it's a good view if you like looking out the window at the 15 (not to mention HEARING the 15 freeway).

A bunch of annoying punks as well in the parking lot, drunk as hell talking sh*t.  Did someone pass out a flyer of this place in the ghetto and skanky side of vegas?

 The Artisan is an exceptional little boutique like gem in the midst of the often overdone Las Vegas scene. It's non-gaming, close to the strip and still manages to have a really strong local following, which seems on paper like a conflict of interests, but is in fact what makes this place one of my favorites in Las Vegas.

 The lounge is what I love the most about the place. With an eclectic decor and an interesting seating arrangement, you can sit at the bar, in one of the booths or with a group of people and still feel like you are getting a sort of intimate experience. If I could create a modern version of what you'd expect of the legend of old Las Vegas, this is what I'd create.

 The rooms are all very small and each is themed after a different painter. If you book on Expedia or Travelocity, you can find REALLY exceptional rates over direct booking. I will say that I've had some underwhelming stay's in the room (hence my not giving this place 4 stars), but it's under new ownership and management, so I'm eager to give it another shot.

The lobby was all ready full with a party at 7pm, and the music was all ready bumping. 

I checked out the lounge/bar/restaurant area. I sat at the bar, and a waitress tried to take my order and then the bartender stepped up and took over my order. Why the waitress would try to take my dinner order while i sat at the bar is beyond me (tips I suppose). The hamburger and fries were really tasty. The rum and coke wasn't strong at all (this was at 7pm, mind you,  before the raging party began.) Total for meal was 20 bucks. 

There is no gambling machines at all in the hotel, quite refreshing. Next door is the Palace Station casino. Kind of a dump and not really worth it with a little tiny poker room.

It took her a week to return my call despite numerous messages and emails. When I did get a hold of her a week before my nuptials, she informed me that the AVN was having their after party there on the day of my wedding. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Was I really going to have porn stars flouncing about while I was in my wedding dress? I have a pretty good sense of humor and I laughed the situation off. Only in Vegas could pornstars be at your reception.
The actual stay was awful. DON'T STAY HERE if you want any sleep. The room next to us had a huge party with a deejay in their room. How is that okay?! There's already a club downstairs! Partiers were traipsing up and down the hall, smoking, and being generally obnoxious. We had to change rooms at 2am. Did I mention that it was the night before the wedding? Deplorable. 
The actual wedding ceremony was only great due to the fact that I got married. Cynthia our ""wedding planner"" assured me she would be there to handle everything. If handling everything means leaving stacks of ugly chairs in plain sight, messing up sound cues (3 songs people!) , and being completely rude to my wedding party and my guests, then yeah, she sure did handle everything. Our friends were in formal wear moving dirty furniture and cleaning the site for the reception because they couldn't find anyone to help. The photographer was laughably bad, the cake was miniature, and we had one waiter for the cocktail reception of 75 people.

After wards, about 25 us went on to the restaurant to eat. I told her to please have extra staff on hand because we knew we were going to be eating there. There was 1 waiter and a restaurant manager that was so rude and clearly didn't know what was going on. It took 2 hours for people to get their food. Friends told me later that their food kept coming out incorrectly and regular patrons were leaving left and right due to anger. The police even showed up to eat dinner, waited forever, walked into the kitchen to find someone, and left after no one acknowledged them for 30 minutes.

So I guess I will start with the 1 stars.
1. Parking is really bad and not labeled well, I got a parking violation sticker on my car from the Valet in area not marked as Valet in the Cantor lot.
2. A lot of the help was very rude and after I asked for the Yelp Drinks menu when I got there one bartender would avoid me until I was the last person waiting for a drink. I will be professional and not call her out. However there were other bartenders that were good too. 
3. The drink prices were too expensive for this type of place, you either need better drinks bigger drinks or drop the prices. There are places on the strip that is cheaper than this. (If you read my reviews I never complan about prices)
4. Small Bathrooms

Ok good stuff, 5 stars
 1.The place looks great inside, I really like comfy chairs and mirrors on ceilings. A great artsy feel that is like wandering into the of a artist on extacy. With the looping Scarface and Pulp Fiction added in as well.
2. It really is a hidden gem off the strip and you would not expect something like this in the area it is in.
3. No gaming and it is small and initmate. It really has a house party feel.",0.108859649123,484,3.58,2010-09,12,0,0,0

The rooms were about $106 per night, with only a few hours prior to our arrival. Parking isn't the best but as long as you read the signs carefully, you won't get any tickets or towed. I felt like I was in some sort of fantastic fairy tale land on shrooms when I arrived. The pool is pretty small but I must admit, it is a nice one. It's pretty crazy though, how many different kinds of people you will see here. One thing that I also love about this place is the real inexpensive bottle service. It's about $190 for a bottle, starting prices of course.  The hotel isn't far from the freeway. So, that's a good thing and a bad thing.

This place is great if you like house DJs and constantly shiver from the dousche chills at most other Vegas clubs.
Its free for locals and open 24 hours on friday and saturdays. The crowd is whatever, and the back patio is a nice place to throw down on a conversation.  For my money its the best place for random run ins, example, a couple weeks ago my Mclovin looking friend starts laying random ""I just broke up with my girlfriend so I really dont give a f**k"" style convo into a brunette about 3 leagues above him. She bites and they talk for a while and when the number exchange came, she said, ""you can find me on twitter, its @jennyhendrix"". 
Sure, this is Vegas, that happens here, but then last week, I spent about 5 minutes talking to someone when she said ""you look familiar"" and I replied with my ""o, you must watch gay porn"" bit. 
She laughed it off and then confessed to me she had done some porn and told me her name etc etc... 
I dont really know the point other than establishing a baseline for the type of people who go here. Maybe nooooooot your babys mama, but then again, who am I to judge,  everybody needs to rock out sometimes right?

The vibe here is great.  The bar and decor is simply amazing.  The other yelper who said it's like the Haunted Mansion is correct.

PARKING
There is only valet parking. If you want to self parking, it must be done around the corner from the hotel on a side street, and then you have to walk. Lame. 

NOISE
It was not made clear on the website that this is one of Vega's few after hours clubs. Since the hotel is only 4 stories the noise inside the rooms is DEAFENING. We got no sleep the entire weekend.

There were plenty of places to sit with friends and have a conversation with them, including the patio which they could smoke while I drank champagne. There was a DJ playing music, but where it was before Midnight it was pretty standard dance fare - but there was a lot of dancing going which is always a bonus. I was only paying $8-10 a drink for wine and champagne so for me it was cheaper than drinking at the strip casinos. Bar staff was friendly, people around us were cool to talk to.

I was introduced to this place by a local friend of mine on one of my visits a few years ago and I fell in love. Today it's one of my absolute favorite places to visit when I go to Vegas. From the outside it's quite funny because it's very industrial looking and it's on a street filled with nothing but strip clubs. But once you get inside it is entering a different world. The decor alone is what is so attractive about this place. It's unique without being pretentious. There's always a great place to lounge and socialize. I love the location-- just off the strip. 

Though what sucks is they only have valet parking. And another tip is if you're visiting better do your research and make sure no special events are going on.

As others have stated parking is valet only and it could be more clearly marked. The valet assumed we were headed to the pool, and when we said we weren't he looked very surprised and told us that the pool parties at the Artisan are something we really needed to check out. I was definitely intrigued by this, and a little sad I didn't have a bikini stashed in my trunk... 

The lobby of the Artisan is beautiful. Definitely something people need to see for themselves, words just can not do the decor justice. My husband and I sat at the bar and pointed out different pieces of artwork to each other that we liked. The first bartender was kind of an asshole, I asked if we could order food in the lounge and his response was to sigh and say ""I guess."" My husband overheard our second bartender (that took over for him after he brought out our drinks) complaining about his work ethic as well so my guess is he wasn't just having a bad day... She did a great job though. We ordered nachos and they took forever because of how busy the pool area was but she was super apologetic about it and we really weren't in a rush... 

After we had our nachos and a couple drinks, we decided to explore the property a bit. Everything inside was dark, elegant and sexy. The pool area was pretty small, with topless sunbathing optional. Unlike some other pools I have been to with topless sunbathing, many of the women I saw at the Artisan pool actually were topless. The dj was spinning some dubstep and people looked like they were really enjoying themselves.

What we actually got:
1. Nice Valet guy.
2. Nice registration clerk, smiley and helpful.
3. Only 1 elevator. 
4. Extremely dark lobby and hallway to the point of being spooky.
5. Very small but cute room. To note that every room features different artists, mine was Roy Lichtenstein room 325.
6. Everything was clean but the bathroom was missing essentials e.g. soap, shampoo, lotion. No biggy, I brought my own. What I did not bring was the blowdryer for my hair. Neither the bathroom had it. So airdry it is.
7. Free porn. Hmmmmmm, what kind of hotel is this? Looks classy but now I'm thinking a Brothel.
8. After dropping our bags we are heading to the famous lounge and see the pool area. When we got to the elevator 2 people that wearing the Hotels  uniform are standing there waiting. They do not greet us. Ok. No biggy. We assume, big mistake, that they are heading down. They dont ask us where we are going, they just kind of blocked our view of the call buttons. When the elevator finally after full 5 minutes gets there it is apparentely going UP! Oops. Inside there was another guy that works there, tall, blond, wearing glasses, sorry I dont have the name, invites us in to ride up with him instead of just waiting again. Very nice guy. We go in and take the ride. On the way back down of course we stop at our original 3rd floor and those two people still there but talking to someone and dont let go of the elevator, just holding it up basically. We are still OK but getting kind of irritated. 
9. The lounge is very very nice. Beautiful art everywhere including the ceiling. Lots to see. The bartender was friendly and fast. Drinks decently priced
10. A  girl wearing a bathing suit walked in to the bar. It looked ridiculous! How is anyone allowed inside being almost naked and dripping water? Fail!
11. We went back to our room to get ready to go out. I was naked when I heard someone just outside the door, then that someone put the cardkey in, I'm thinking Wrong room, the door wont open, they will realize it and it will be over. Big mistake! The door was actually unlocked and started to open when I screamed to stop. I grabbed the towel and looked out just to find a girl that works there( just to say that it was one of the people by the elevator earlier) just walking away. I asked her if she needed anything, her reply was, verbatim,""I got the wrong room"". WTF? How about knocking?
 12. We left for the evening. Came back around 5am and saw extremely drunk girl standing up on all fours and throwing up in the bushes. Really? Boutique Hotel? The lobby is packed with people, loud music, party is going on full blast! Very cute doorman. 
We actually had no problem falling asleep with all the commotion going outside. In the morning we checked out and decided that we will NEVER come back here again.

The manager was training a new front desk person and both were incredibly friendly and kind. We went up to our small but beautiful room and quickly went down to the lounge for some tasty cocktails. We were greeted by beautiful and kind bartenders who were extremely quick with our beverages. After a few drinks we went to Mood restraunt for dinner. A manager greeted and seated us immediately and he himself brought us our bread basket. We were then introduced to our servers Wes and I believe the woman's name was solie.. Not 100% sure but she was of African American decent and was super awesome. They kept our drinks flowing and delivered our meals in a timely manner.

Yes, as some other reviewers have stated you can hear the music from the pool and club all day and most of the evening on weekends. You can also hear noise from outside like the sound of Harleys driving by.  We were on the 4th floor so the noise level was acceptable, we were able to get a little sleep. 

I'd advise against ordering food in the bar area, as tempting as it may be. I did not learn my lesson after the the last time I was here... Over an hour had passed before I inquired where our food was, and then when we received it the food was not even correct. It tasted good though... 

The people at the Artisan to party were quite an interesting group to watch. We could have done without the douchey guys that don't understand the concept of personal space, but otherwise it was a fun time.

First they were black leather sandals. 

Second why does this not apply to girls, as we walked away we saw a group head over. One had on flip-flops, we said let's see what happens, they all walked right in. Now these girls weren't dressed slutty, and they were not super model attractive. Normal people.

Their restaurant is delicious for breakfast I ordered the french toast which was breaded in cornflakes and cinnamon mmm mmm good! For dinner I had a Caesar salad and I believe chicken Marsala very tender chicken and the service was very good. 

Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to go into there beautiful pool because it was winter but its absolutely gorgeous and ill have to try it out next time. 

I have no complaints about this place I had an amazing time by far my favorite hotel in Las Vegas you must try this place out if you like something different and unique!!!",0.235346235795,105,3.38,2011-07,14,6,9,8

Thanks Artisan After hours! I really enjoyed the smallness of it all, and the music was off the chain Saturday night, well Sunday morning. Guys make sure to wear T shirts, Polo's, or button down shirts, and no shorts. The drinks are pretty expensive, $ 12 for vodka and soda, but that's Vegas. The bartenders are cool, considering everyone's state of mind at 6am. Security is chill, just don't act a fool. This place kept going till 8:30am, and the die hard partiers still kept on dancing, till the end!

36.143437,-115.169098,1,3.5,"I had heard about this place from a friend and was excited to try a new place in Vegas that was off the strip and looked to be a cool little hideaway from the regular crazy that is Las Vegas. 

Wow was I mistaken.

We arrived Friday afternoon and were impressed with the decor and the design of this hotel. It is really unique and for those into this sort of look (turn of the century Parisian art gallery with a little bit of a hipster brothel thrown in for fun), it's gorgeous. The staff seemed friendly enough and the front bar was cute and seemed a nice place to grab a drink before we headed out for the night. 

When we returned at around 1130, we were greeted by two no-necked stereotypical huge doormen in suits who asked for our ID's even though we were guests of the hotel. As we walked to the elevator to go up to our room we noticed that the bar had gotten louder and the music was that annoying no melody thumping bad techno. But whatever, not my scene, but I'm okay with whatever they want to do. 

Until we arrived back in our room on the 3rd floor and realized that the bass from the bar downstairs was SO LOUD it was rattling our beds and making it impossible to sleep. The hotel had pre-warned us that things get loud and offered us earplugs. They didn't help. About 4 am, after no sleep, I finally called the front desk to try to get us moved UP to a higher floor number where maybe the noise level would be lessened. BRIAN answered the phone and offered NO HELP. He was rude and unapologetic, not to mention simply uninterested. After taking a rather strong sleeping pill at 4 am and still using the earplugs, I finally was able to get some sleep. 

The next morning, we asked again about moving up to a higher floor to try to avoid the thumping. Though the morning staff was a bit more apologetic, they still seemed really uninterested and it took us pestering the front desk clerk all day to get them to move us to the 4th floor.

While waiting for the room switch, we decided to go have a lounge by the pool. The pool is just like the club all over again. A guy who looked like a reject from Jersey Shore DJ'ed all afternoon and kept the music SO Loud we couldn't talk, and there were several groups of Jersey Shore wannabes being louder and raucous and obviously drunk. Our pool experience was ruined as well.

Finally getting into our now on the 4th floor room late in the afternoon, I was just happy to get the hell out of there and go out to meet some friends in town, but again, when we returned around midnight, the noise level was again SO LOUD that the bass was thumping through the floor - even 2 floors above the club. Though at least this time, it was muffled enough that with the earplugs allowed me to get some sleep - even though I could still hear it a bit. 

This place is ridiculous. It is trying way too hard to be cool. It is low class no matter what the decor looks like. The food in the restaurant is just OK, not spectacular. The cast of Jersey Shore would love it. I did not. I will not be back, I will tell all of my friends how bad our experience was and I will post anywhere and everywhere that this is the worst place in Vegas.",0.0354671717172,4,1.75,2011-10,0,0,0,1

The only negatives I have is that they were out of a lot of products-wine especially.  Wes made some good recommendations so we tried what he suggested and made do... They were also out of some food items so we had to switch courses.  We got the filet-which was fantastic but slightly overcooked.  The lobster mac and cheese was to die for!

36.143437,-115.169098,4,3.5,"Bottom Line (in the first line...lol):  I'll be back.

PRO:  The price was awesome ...about $100/nite w/ bottle of champagne included on our arrival : )

PRO:  Bedding was comfy;  Very Clean;  rooms were individualized/unique.

PRO:  The hotel lobby, bar, etc. is GORGEOUS in a tongue in cheek gothic sort of way - just really fun decor that makes you want to take a lot of sexy pics ; )

CON:  Rooms weren't as luxurious & decadent looking as they are in the pics - - but this could be that we got one of the rinky-dinkier rooms.   I did notice some rooms looked way cooler than others.  Also, the bathroom amenities were terrible - - - but, i'll give those up for the lower price!  ....i like to use my own shamp/conditioner anyway.

PRO/CON:  Even though they're a smaller operation than what you'd find on the strip, they DO have a restaurant w/ room service.  Sometimes just eating something....anything...will help you feel more human the morning after many redbull/vodkas.  The room service did its job...our blood sugar levels were normalized.  
.......However, the food was just barely ""eh""....the chorizo quesadilla was sooooo greasy - but, I'm probably just being a Hermosa Beach brat.  It's a quesadilla - they're greasy sometimes.  That being said...if the room service is any indication, I'd steer clear of their restaurant for dinner reservations.

CON:  Even though they're a boutique hotel, they still charge the ""highway robbery"" prices of the big places like The Cosmopolitan.  I almost agree with high prices at a hotel that has so much upkeep (like the gorgeous ""Chandelier Bar"" at Cosmo....) but, in a smaller place like Artisan, I don't agree with such a raping for 2 simple Vodka/Diets - with tip: $24.  Screw you...I'll bring my own vodka & order a diet next time.

CON:  We didn't have much hot water : (  Cool/Lukewarm showers suck.

PRO:  In October the pool was warm, quiet & relaxing - no music (except what we were playing on our laptop).  Daybeds & cabanas were free.  I heard that during the summer this is a much more ""happenin'"" pool spot, but i get the feeling that it's a little more chill party than what you'd find at those frat house on steroids type pools.

PRO:  The party downstairs is crazy on busy nights (we were there Fri & Sat nights & the place was nuts until 7am.  One of the best DJ's I've ever heard...such an ecclectic mix of house, world music, pop, & electronic.

CAUTION:  We had to hit it early Sat night b/c my gf wasn't feeling well & yes, I could hear the party downstairs, but honestly it wasn't more than just a soft murmur in the background.  But, we were on the 4th floor ....if you're a baby about noise, just ask for the 4th floor and save yourself some whining.  Those people on the 2nd floor were probably getting an earful.

When we got there, were was barely anyone there, so the bar wasn't packed at all, and the bartenders basically decided not to serve us for at least 30minutes. It seemed like a last resort for them to serve us. We had 7 girls, and waited at least 30 minutes each time to get a drink. Even when I went by myself, I had to wait at least 15 minutes longer than anyone else, even people that showed up after me got drinks before I did. It was pretty ridiculous, and I'm a fairly patience person. Our guy friends had gotten a table and had ordered 2 bottles, and it took the waitresses at least 45minutes to bring out the bottles, mind you, there was still barely anyone at the club, so there was no reason why it should've taken so long to get drinks. 
The crowd was quite eclectic. There were some people dressed up because it is Vegas, but then since this is off the strip, there were people dressed up as cows, Jesus, and prisoners.

We made the mistake of booking a room on a Friday and Saturday night. The first night i did not sleep a wink. I expected the music to be loud and to continue to the early morning so that was fine. BUT what i wasn't ready for were the crackheads next door that brought the party to their room and the hallway and kept it going until the next morning. THEN the couple next door argued from 6am-8am and we could hear every word because the walls of the rooms are paper thin. Worst night ever, it was so bad that I had to ask for a room change.

CONS:
~worst night's sleep ever. I had to buy earplugs and sleeping pills for my second night.
~The doors are all a little off so everyone has to slam their door to close it which starts to hurt the ears after a while
~The room had really poor craftsmanship. Popcorn ceiling, the bathroom felt dirty and the tile grout looks like a 5 year old did it. There was also damage in the ceiling above the shower that did not look safe.
~The hotel is right off the freeway (seriously super close, it's practically  IN THE FREEWAY! The off ramp should be named 'Artisan Hotel') it's in a very sketchy looking area. Down the street from about 5 strip clubs and an Adult store that advertises 'Adult TAPES'...not even DVDs!?!?!? haha
~The windows  were so thin they might as well have been open since I could hear every car and activity that was happening outside. 
~It was supposed to be a non smoking hotel but the hallway on the top floor smelled like smoke and sometimes the smell would creep into our room. 

PROS:
~The bed was soft and comfortable.
~The sliders we had at the restaurant were good for an evening snack. 
~The decor in the lobby is absolutely beautiful. I loved looking at all the art they had up. This almost made me give them two stars but then I remembered the lack of sleep and how it made me feel like a zombie the following day almost ruining my vacation.

Some reviewers complain about noise - who goes to Vegas to sleep anyway?? I personally haven't had a problem with noise the 2 or 3 times I've stay here.

Valet is sort of rude, we waited outside for at least 10-5 minutes and he was actually just in the corner smoking instead of doing his job. He is not as welcoming as he probably should be considering he's the first person to greet you at the hotel. I would recommended to park across the street in their ""self-parking"" which is just a dirt parking lot, literally dirt no concrete. Its not a far walk though, it's literally across the street saves you time to wait on the valet that's pretty slow and saves you money from tipping out the rude valet guy. The ladies st the counter were however very polite. The bus boy and housekeeping were the most courteous. We arrived at our hotel at around 5:45 pm when check in's at 4pm and our room still wasn't ready! we had to wait about 8 mins, considering the housekeeping were very polite we did not really mind. We asked for our complimentary champagne that the hotel offers you from booking on their website and house keeping was very efficient in delivery our bottle another plus! One thing I didn't like though was thst when house keeping cleans your room they do not provide you with  new soap and shampoo bottles which most hotels do. The phone in the room also did not work so we could not call for housekeeping. The lounge is open till 8 am and it does get crackkin!

Explanation: I was here Saturday night with a large group of Yelpers to celebrate the birthdays of two incredible ladies Angela H. and Jade W. They were given a bottle of vodka and a table compliments of the hotel.

This was the link we used to access the specific details about the DJ and specials for that night. It's since been updated to the coming weekend, but it was the same drink specials....so we thought.

http://artisanhotel.com/blog/saturday/

Of course I see a DJ I like and $5 Ketel One drinks and get all kinds of excited. WRONG. We go to the bar and order two Ketel drinks and they were served to us in the smallest plastic cup and told the total was $20. WTF Artisan? What happened to the $5 drink specials? We then wait for someone who said they were the manager only this man was in a black Artisan t-shirt like the bussers wear. Strange. He then tells us that it says on the site that the specials are subject to change at any given time. Well, I sure don't see that written anywhere on the event flyer, do you? 

Since they were not honoring the special they were advertising we paid for our drinks, tipped and took off. The birthday girls and the rest of the group shortly followed. See Artisan, you just aren't cool anymore. The crowd isn't what it use to be. There IS no crowd anymore. By pulling what you did to us Saturday night I'm sure you will continue to be empty.

36.143437,-115.169098,1,3.5,"I have been to Artisan After Hours 5 times. My first impression upon entering it on a Saturday morning (Friday After Hours) is that this place is REALLY FUCKING NASTY.  Unfortunately, my opinion has never changed.

There are bums and hookers everywhere. The ratio runs about 10% female (9 out of 10 of those are trashy escorts), and 90% creepy dudes that didn't get some while they were clubbing from 1030 to 4:00. You can look at their faces to know that they are desperate for some affection. There is a small outside patio next to a flight of stairs where losers sit next to each other telling bullshit war stories about how ""hard"" they are. 

You also have a really tiny room that is (the dance floor). It's like the size of a dive bar. Too many people inside, and YOU DO NOT WANT TO SIT ON THE TABLES. The hookers that took over the spot will think your a new mark and probably will try to lure you into their hotel room where a big burly guy is gonna rob you at gunpoint. 

I guess for a heterosexual chick that doesn't make her living by bed hopping might find this a paradise, a farm full of semi-attractive males that only wants someone to love and care for. But for the masses of single, charming, male bachelors... you would want to try your luck at the Drai's After Hours in the Bills Gambling Hall and Casino on Flamingo & Las Vegas Blvd. It's a much better atmosphere over there, better ratio of male-to-female, and the bouncers actually give a shit about keeping the place upbeat. 

I seen a couple of folks at the valet line bitch out their spouses over the phone while I was waiting for my car to come back. A lot of the creepy chomo (child molester looking) type here. 

Oh, and for first-timers, you NEED to bring your car to the valet. There is no self-parking here. Come in early if you really want to come here, say about 3:30AM when the real clubs are dying down.

Update: 

So I got a email saying that alot of people are putting in complaints for this review. I don't know why. I'm not slandering, i'm telling the truth of what I have experienced here. Maybe some folks like the hookers that come in here. 

Well I got dragged in here one more time because one of my friends happened to have his peer host a birthday party here. Nothing fancy, just a birthday hangout. On my last visit it looks like Artisan Afterhours cleaned itself up a bit. A little bit less hookers than what I usually encounter (even though I did run into another one at the Wynn outside the Tryst Nightclub at the same day). 

Seems like the crowd this time (around late-December) got less shady. The bartenders have very good visual memory of faces. I accidentally left my card at the counter, and when I came back to the bar she remembered my face and handed me back my credit card.. 

I didn't have a ride back home so I rented out a room. The guy at the counter cut me some slack and gave me a room for $46 + collateral ($150), usually it goes for $80. Played around with the TV, and I discovered that the TVs in here have free porn channels. Hahaha! 

I managed to sleep for 3 hours, but then some random white lady keeps banging at my room's door looking for a ""Allison"". She won't leave me alone and I kept telling her to go away. Around 10:00AM I got into the elevator to check out and I ran into the lady again. She's a really nosey stranger, and I declined sitting next to her at the taxi stop because asked me a lot of questions about drugs and where to find them.",0.0181031492874,84,2.9,2011-11,1,11,13,0

First, we stayed during the week, so we didn't experience the club at all. No one at the pool because, well, it was winter and kind of cold-ish outside. I would give this place another shot in the summertime to check out the pool scene. However, I was told (my our cab driver, of all people) that the after after hours scene here is crazy. I don't know if that's good crazy, or scary crazy or what, so... yeah. Not sure if I'm up for that. 

We stayed in the Picasso mini-suite. The room looked chic, but needs some work! The carpet was LUMPY. Not sure what kind of stuff is under the rug, but I don't want to find out! The lamp didn't work (no bulb), and in the cold light of day, we could see imperfections all over the place (places that needed some paint, a little better cleaning, etc). 

In the bathroom, there's a rusty vent right above the tub. :|  No space to put your stuff (toothbrush, makeup, etc.) Sharing this bathroom between two people was nearly impossible. We also didn't anticipate so much noise from the freeway outside... it definitely more than I thought it would be. The amenities were sparse (you get a shampoo and a soap. That's all). It's cool if that's all you get, but with a boutique hotel, I thought - yeah, they'll at least provide the hair stuff and some soap for the sink AND tub. Oh well.

However, we did like that the room had a walk-in closet, a mini-bar (fridge WITH humidor in it... nice!), a safe, and some other amenities. The price was better than places on the strip (although keep in mind you'll pay about $15 each way to get to the strip, and that's if your cab driver knows where they're going. We had one dude drive us PAST Palace Station and then loop back - all on our dime), and the customer service was really great. Valet guys are really cool, and after a few days, I felt like everyone ""knew"" us. 

So yeah. We'll probably give this place one more try in the summer/spring. I love that this is a 21+ establishment, so no kids running around (I hate that!).",0.0633526383526,207,3.97,2008-08,8,0,2,1

36.143437,-115.169098,4,3.5,"We have stayed here twice now. It is definitely for a certain type of person I believe and that is probably why I felt compelled to write this review from that vantage point.
I have read reviews for them on Hotels, and TripAdvisor and such and its a bummer that in most instances people rate them lower because of the noise. Well.... The Artisan is a cool hotel set right dab on top of an excellent After hours club. So.... in knowing that (and they definitely aren't shy about making this known) anyone looking for a place to stay in Las Vegas where they will actually need to sleep, needs to look elsewhere. 
It was kind of interesting that this past weekend when we went there were complaints on the 4th floor of there being too much noise on the floor... I thought to myself that it must REALLY be bad up there if they are complaining about that over the noise coming from downstairs. I don't get it personally.... each time we have stayed here this place was more like a college dorm on the weekend rather than somewhere you honestly thought people would be sleeping. Down the hall from us there sounded like there was a DJ and an additional dance floor that the Artisan Elite were keeping to themselves, but I digress.
So the review is about the hotel and not the after hours so I have to say... we dig the ambiance, spooky haunted mansion feel and even the bouncers seem to play into that as well... or maybe its just me that they seem a little menacing. There are a couple of bars in the lobby that once the club opens and gets underway, these can cause the lobby to get pretty crowded; along with the line to get into the club.
My only beef with the hotel is this one thing... Back on that last wknd in January I realized after getting home that I had left my very awesome copper leather coat there. I called immediately when I realized this, which put the call going in about 25 minutes after we had left. The guy at the front desk got right on it, had the cleaning staff bring the jacket down and he himself put the jacket in lost and found for me and called to leave me a voice mail that I could come and retrieve it. Well unfortunately for me I couldn't make it back that day and ended up leaving for a couple of weeks of work. I went back this past wknd (2/26/2012) and no jacket. They did not tell me that there was a time period that my jacket could be there so I didn't feel a rush to have someone go for me and retrieve it. Hotel Lost and Found is always one of those things that I have wondered about.... where do our things really go?",0.0913084215168,213,3.92,2009-11,5,1,3,0

Boutique hotels are the hip thing nowadays. If you haven't been before, you'll find the ultimate cool factor in the decor. The walls and ceilings are littered with unusual paintings. And the gothic-themed furnishings give this place its character.  The Artisan is unlike any other hotel in Las Vegas. Its dark, mysterious, and 'romantic'--if your into that sort of thing.

AFTERHOURS: You can drink, party, and crash all in the same place! The lonely bar of the Artisan has turned into one of the hottest places to party in Las Vegas. LV Weekly named it the Best Afterhours in town! If you can get past the crowd-control issue and all the people wearing sunglasses indoors, then get over here: no cover, no line, no dress-code, no hassle. They're open Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. And DJ MikeAttack & Stellar make regular appearances here. If you don't like house, you won't like it here

BIRTHDAY DEAL: If it's your birthday month, Afterhours will comp you a table and  a bottle of Sky. All you need is 6+ people, an ID, and money for tip. Email bday@artisanhotel.com to book this deal. Can't get that at the clubs...

ROOMS: I've only been in the standard ""Artisan Classic"" rooms. Despite being small, they're clean, comfy, and well-decorated. The window cracks open for ventilation and the bathrooms aren't too shabby. The ceilings are pretty low so tall people might feel a little cramped. But, they're incredibly cheap! We're talking $50-60 during the weekdays and $100-140 on weekends.

I took a cab from the airport and it came to about $25(?) with tip. The hotel is quite a ways from the strip and there is not much around it except for Shari's Cabaret. I heard there's a huge strip club nearby too but I didn't see it.  It felt isolated but I found it kind of nice that way since I knew I was going to be in the thick of things the next day.

I had to wait a few minutes before the front desk agent appeared but I used the time to look at all the paintings and art in the lobby.  There's lots to see. There was no one around. At all. It was, after all, only 1:30 on a Wednesday. This place is known for their after parties on the weekend and it was definitely not the weekend.  The agent emerged from the back room and told me that I probably couldn't check in til about 3:15.  Check in is usually at 4. I expected that so I made sure to pack my bikini in my carry on and changed in the bathroom.  When I returned to the front desk to ask directions to the pool, the agent asked me for my driver's license and credit card, checked me in early, AND gave me a complimentary bottle of champagne.  Love her! 

The room was average sized and the bed was comfy. Two complimentary bottles of water were in the room as well as free porn (channel 69 ha ha!). lol.  Ice was to be picked up from the bar in the lobby. The water turned cold mid-shower the following morning and the blow dryer was noticeably broken but I had such a good time during my stay there (combination of the company I met and the really cool, quirky hotel) that it didn't phase me.  I wasn't in my room for most of the night (and who is anyways?) but when I was, I could hear lots of people going in and out of their rooms.  What fun! lol

I could see the pool area being a fun place to hang out once people are there.  When I got down to the pool, I was the only one.  Talk about ""me"" time. lol!  It was great!  I'm older (pushing 40 BUT still semi-hip) so I don't mind not being in the middle of things. The weather didn't really cooperate though.  Stupid clouds.  I did get a little sun minus annoying tan lines :-) The only people that I saw in the pool area were employees that were discussing arrangements for a wedding with a client. And then I met a boy. Oh yes! Let me just say that even though I stayed at a five star resort and received VIP treatment the following night, I had a better time staying at the Artisan hanging out with JT ;-)

Yes, you are away from the strip and yes, you do have to wait at least 10-15 minutes for a cab (you do anyways when you're in a long ass taxi line), but it is a great deal (came to about $80 with tax on a WEEKDAY) and you can go topless without the crowds ;-) I'm up here quite a few times during the year for work and and I will definitely be flying in a day earlier just to stay here.

3/ Service at the bar on a Sunday night ( slow ) was subpar. The bartender was not unfriendly. Just detached and not interested in providing suggestions or good service. 
4/ Room key card won't work. Annoying when you come back to the hotel late and a little drunk.

 First of all we had a Complimentary breakfast (which was great) but we made the mistake of ordering coffee, it was $5 for a cup of coffee!!! Usually that wouldn't bother me but the coffee was DISGUSTING..cold..stale etc, and none of us drank more than a few sips!!  When we spoke to the manager about it he basically said ""I DON'T CARE, WE HAVE TO MAKE MONEY"" I was in shock at the lack of compassion sarcasm and rudeness. Considering we are staying at a hotel that is worse than Circus Circus you would think they would be more accommodating so they can keep the few guests they have. 

Then while my friend is taking a shower the ceiling starts leaking, and not just water but some brown stuff. We called downstairs and they had someone up immediately who told us that there were two guests upstairs taking a shower together!! You could imagine our disgust! We called downstairs bc we wanted another room they told us ""NO, WE ARE BOOKED"" but the funny thing is there were 5 rooms on our floor that were empty our entire stay! The maintenance man fixed the leak but not before I saw MOLD!!!!! Normally I would have ran out the room and never turned back, but my friends reminded me that if they weren't gonna give us our $5 back for our disgusting coffee, did I think they would give us money back for our stay?? 

The pool was nice but I would compare it to an apartment pool. Cabanas were first come first serve on Friday which was nice.

Our room key hardly ever worked which caused us to have to go downstairs multiple times

There is no ice machine so again you have to go down to the bar to get ice

Drinks were pretty expensive. Don't get me wrong I know its Las Vegas, but usually the lower starred hotels offer cheaper drinks and/or food. I felt like we were charged a Venetian price but staying at Motel 6. 

Bottom line is this hotel in my opinion is a 1 or 2 star and the service is exactly that, but the price was the same as some of the hotels on the strip but we would have gotten a better location and better service.

Even though most of the big hotels in LV accept dogs now, it is extremely difficult to have to walk far distances to get to the elevators, across the million of people, and the casino just to take you dogs to go potty! Good luck with that! the ARTISAN Hotel was just PERFECT!! it is only 4-5 floors high, so you can take the elevator or just simply the side stairs in be at the lobby level within a minute! There is a great area on the back, just after you pass the pool with gravel and yard, very private and you can take your dogs there for their potty time!  The staff was soooo nice, helpful and extremely accommodating!!! they are very dog friendly as the guests staying there as well, so you will feel very comfortable!! The rates are also very affordable. Some hotels will charge you an arm and a leg for a ""pet fee"" .

After living in vegas for 3+ years I received the worst service possible at the bar there.  Sarah Jane's review is right on when she says they OVERCHARGE at the bar.  If it's not an overcharge the prices are ridiculous.

$19 for a small glass of baileys and a beer.  It's hilarious that a place charging these prices doesn't even have decent beer by the bottle (amstel light etc). 

Even worse, the chic took forever to come over and take our order (even though the place was near empty).  Then after we order....SHE HAS A 2 MINUTE CONVERSATION WITH ANOTHER EMPLOYEE before completing our order.  Zero class and zero customer service.

It's no wonder the place was near empty at 11pm.  I took a sip of my dates baileys and it was really flat...I could tell the bottle was old.  My date thought it tasted fine so whatever.

For a few bucks more I can take my date to the Mandarin Bar and have a 5* experience with the best possible service.  Why would I return here???

If was funny because the bartender looked over at me as I watched her as she rung in my order.  She included an ""upgrade"" charge to a single drink charge....the line said ""martini upgrade"" even though the drink was a small glass of baileys.

The valet scoffed at me when I gave him a $3 tip as we left.

WTF is wrong with these people?????  Whoever owns this place needs to clean house and start over with this bartender, some of the valets, etc.

I am just going to bullet point the issues:
* Door Handle broken, had to open door with shoulder.
* Room keys kept failing went through almost 13 in 6 days.
- even the Night Security's keys weren't working
* Elevator needs key to work- but that broke as well so keep to the stairs.
* the AC is pretty worthless so we tried to open the window and the window pane started to fall out.
* The Bathroom door kept sticking and wouldn't open across the tile without sticking
* The bathtub drain broke
* The paintings in our room were creepy, disturbing and unwanted. 
* They play music all night- but their walls and windows hold nothing back.
*They claim for free water and ear plugs but we had to ask each time.
*Our room didn't get cleaned the first day, when I called that afternoon about 4- they said it was too late.
*They never restocked towels enough or the 'extras' the claimed to provide, my friend had to take a roll of toilet paper of the cart so she could have ANY.
*The lighting in the lobby is beyond too dim, so when you come from the pool- to the only bathroom in the lobby, you're walking on slippery tile, blind- and your eyes adjust just as you are about to run into a beam right in front of the pathway to the bathroom. They finally had to tape something white to it.
*The Pool was a joke, small and it got so hot we had to get out because it was like a sauna. 
*It's a rip off, you have to rent a cabana($500-$750) or a lounge(~$250)- or else you're in the pool or sitting on the hot cement. But even the Cabanas and lounges were poor quality and felt like they were going to burn your skin.

Misti Y described it best by comparing it to the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland.  Or maybe it wasn't the best analogy, but that reference sold me.  Here is a short bullet list:

Pros:
- interesting, to say the least, decor
- Topless pool with pretty good DJ
- dark bar/club that looked good for secretly canoodling
- club that had people ARRIVING at 7am (as I was just returning from EDC); and though I did not personally enter, it looked poppin

Cons:
- location off the strip, which is not convenient for the walk back from the club (unless you're here for the after-after-hours party)
- smaller rooms than what you'd expect from those big resorts on the strip
- pool is much smaller than expected (so here I am resetting your expectations) -- which can be so awesome if there were many topless girls smothered against you... but there were only 8 other people when I visited, and one girl that was topless
- can be hard to sleep with all the music/partying... not the best if you've got kids

I'll probably be back to visit the club someday!  Or maybe EDC next year, since you won't have to deal with the amazingly shitty traffic on the strip!",0.241333333333,293,3.7,2008-07,11,2,2,1

The decor and the staff will bring this rating up to 2 stars versus 0 if I had that option.  Upon check in the staff were nice the decor really fun and cool.  But beware when walking in because it is really really dark after coming in from outdoors.  Not knowing the layout of the lobby many obstacles may get in your way as yours eyes are adjusting.  We check into a small clean room in a gothic kind of decor pretty cool.  Sadly 2 of the 4 rooms we had, the air-conditioning broke.  The staff worked hard on it and it worked well enough to not want to repack and move rooms.  As mentioned in previous posts there are speakers located all around the hotel with Techno music blasting.  I did not mind this much because we were here for a party not a spa day...  Sadly after a couple of drinks I got off on the wrong floor and was trapped there for a bit because the elevator wouldn't stop on that floor for me.  If you go the stairs route please be very careful the railings are not secure and extremely wobbly.  

So with all these things mentioned one thing capped the experience off and as I sit here writing I am still thinking of dropping the extra star.  The Artisan is a Valet only hotel which is fine because I really wouldn't want my car sitting in an open lot across the street anyways.  So you always hear stories about your car getting a joy ride or a scratch or something crazy happens in the movies right?!  Not in real life, right?!?!   Yes, it happens in real life sadly it happened to me.  Upon check out the Valet goes to get my car and comes back after a bit and says he can't get the key in the ignition.  So I take the key and say ""ahh, ok let me try""  Go out to the car and as I try I notice my key is bent.  Well, that will do it!  SERIOUSLY try to take your key right now and bend it, go ahead try you won't be able to.  I have no idea what the heck they did to bend my key!  What ever they did was extreme because car keys really don't bend!  LOL   The staff again is kind and tried to help me but the Valet is hired out so there is only so much that can be done on their part so I will leave the extra star. 

 I will be dealing with the company who is hired to get my key replaced but sadly my experience at the Artisan is marred beyond fixing.  I don't know if I will ever be back I certainly won't drive if I am...",0.0710873015873,170,3.81,2010-06,8,1,3,2

 Gone are the cozy little areas to sit, unless you want bottle service. They've also removed all the tables around the bar and even the bar stools. The bartender explained to us that since they are known as an after-hours place, they don't want people sitting at the bar, because people can't get up to it to get a drink. I might have agreed with that decision,  were we not literally the only people in the bar.

  On a Saturday night at 11pm there were more employees than customers and more confusion than good times to be had. We already had drinks in our hand and were sent outside to get a stamp; great job, team. The bartender had a terrible attitude...until it was time to tip her. Also, our drinks were served in plastic solo cups; how tacky is that? You charge $15 a drink and you can't afford something a little nicer? We went out the patio, where we were told we had to buy a hookah to sit at a table. A hookah? The patio was also nearly empty, so it just made us feel unwelcome and that there were far too many rules to follow for us to enjoy ourselves. 

 What I love about this place; the decor. It's a beautiful place, there is no denying that. I like that it's been cleaned up, because it felt like it was circling the drain the last time I stayed in a room there. I also love that there isn't any gaming. That's the end of my list, currently.

36.143437,-115.169098,1,3.5,"First off, I want to be clear. This rating is for the horrible customer service we experienced. 

I came with a party of 3 and we stayed here due to the inflated prices from the iHeart Radio festival. We didn't mind it being off the strip and it's ""supposed"" to be a boutique hotel. 

Everything was great for the first night. The next morning, we left around 10:30 AM and made sure to take off the Do Not Disturb sign and when we came back around 7:30 PM we found our room not yet serviced. Clearly we were forgotten. We called the front desk and was put on hold several times. Eventually we got through and we told the front desk receptionist that we our room was not serviced. To which she replies, with no apology, ""oh, okay."" Ridiculous. Anyway, we were not in the mood to argue and we asked for clean towels. 1 hour later, still no towels. Basically, one of us had to shower and with no clean towels. We eventually picked up the towels from the receptionist later in the evening.

What takes the icing off the cake and what inadvertently allowed us to decide to never come back was the horrible gatekeeper/ bouncer for the after hours club. We came back to the hotel (with a room key clearly visible in our hands) and was basically verbally assaulted by the bouncer. As if stating we were staying in the hotel with a key and letting him know which room number we were in was not enough, he wanted our names. Seriously? His reply: ""YES, SERIOUSLY"". What's up with the attitude? Get over yourself. 

Pros: cheap prices, not far from strip.
Cons: Loud after hours party (below on lobby level), no house keeping, lack of taxi access, no organization of entire hotel, and the worst customer service you will encounter.

- Unique decor, but extremely dark. Wouldn't hurt to turn on a light or two.
- Only 1 elevator that takes an hour to get you to your room and down. 
- Our room was not serviced after our first night.
- Called front desk numerous times and could not get through and had to personally go downstairs to request for fresh towels. 
- Waited an hour and still no towels. One of our girls had to shower using a dirty towel.
- This place is known for their after hour club (which we were completely unaware of) and you can clearly hear the techno music from the 3rd floor pounding away. Extremely difficult to relax after a long day with all that going on. 
- Bouncer was VERY rude with a extremely bad attitude and would not let us back into the hotel even after standing with us while we were waiting on our cab a few hours before.

There's a lovely internet meme going around: No Arty, No Party. It's the damn truth.

The decor and style of the hotel - it's all true. It's dark, artsy, creepy, and adds an amazing ambiance that you have to experience.

This place does not get off and poppin' until about 2 AM. This is after hours. You go to the club then roll over to the Artisan. 

The music is house. DJ Stellar is resident on Fridays and DJ Mike Attack kicks out the beats on Saturday. 

There is definitely a PLUR/Rave vibe here. Tons of people packed into a small hotel bar. There are never any fights. People come as they are. It's a beautiful thing. There are all walks of life: rave kids, to older folks, to club rats, to artisans. It's truly a nice mosaic.

Drinks run about $12 a pop and bottled water will cost you $6 a go. I usually order a bottle of water and refill it at the lobby.

As for awesomeness, a basic bottle will run you about $275 (SKYY VODKA) and during your birthday month you can reserve a comped bottle. Just call it in ahead of time. You need at least 6 in your party.

Outside on the patio, there are HOOKAHS available for $25 a pop. Debra, the hookah goddess, has created her own blend called ""Fucking Amazing"" and it is: FUCKING AMAZING. It's fruity awesomeness.

Inside the lounge/bar area there is NO smoking! (YAY!) There is a small restaurant in there and food is available 24/7.

For the first six years or so, I went out of my way to stay with Artisan. It's difficult to find friends who share the same interests, quirks, values, and sense of style. The vibe here was relaxed and without pretense.

Perhaps it's the distance between us, but Artisan has betrayed this friendship. What once was a hotel concept is now a club-event driven space, elements of which I even supported and mentioned to family run management before it sold to current ownership group. The problem is, this venue no longer has the Hospitality part of hotel ownership in its personality. 

It's not the little things I'm concerned with. I can live with a non working remote for TV, no coffee service anywhere in hotel because the club still hasn't finished the night at 8AM, the special All Night event on 3rd floor that spills up to 4th, where two out of five people I recommended this place to are staying this weekend.  It's not the restaurant that's been closed since check in (yes, I'm still here, writing from the spectacularly overblown Aria @ City Center) or increased costs of taxi service getting in and out of this industrial area, not under Artisan's control. No, these things are silly. The breach of trust with this friendship has to do with commitment and lack of communication, even with a flashy website and extra doormen each night. 

Promises broken, reservations for things like a cabana party lost, dismissive staff in bar who rightfully look at their jobs as a Bar gig and not Hotel environment, the list goes on but you get the idea.

There is no question that the decor of the Artisan is legendary.  The theme of the wedding was zombie/fetish so it was the perfect venue.  However, the wedding guests were shocked when the planner approached the bride & groom after the ceremony to try and re-negotiate the contract so they could get more money out of them.  THIS HAPPENED WHILE THE WEDDING WAS IN PROGRESS.

After that disgraceful little scene passed we had the reception during which the dinner portion of the evening was so badly handled that I gave up my place at the table because the food was not being served.  It seems the servers didn't know who was having what so the food was probably sitting around in the kitchen.  Many guests who had the steak option have reported they got ill from it.

My friends threw an awesome wedding in spite of what the Artisan event managers did to try and ruin their special day.  I cannot recommend this venue to anyone who wants to plan a special event.

There's a back patio where people can smoke hookah and get smashed.  Totally fun.

Why I can't give this place 5 stars is the fact that the guy/girl ratio was insanely skewed.  There's was soooo many guys.  Which was a huge downer.

I had a couple of drinks, cant tell how much they charged, but ended up paying 40 bucks plus tax and tips. These drinks were served in a cheap crappy plastic cups. Nothing special. Nothing fancy. You cant even compare with these pricey drinks at XS or Marquee or whatever.

Service,,, not just the unfriendly bartender but even the valet parking guy made me feel like I am staying at Motel 6. Pretty awful.

I met a girl at the bar who was probably way too into me for it to be realistic. Bought her and myself a drink with cash. She then proceeded to buy many drinks for her and her friends, who then told the bartenders I agreed to pay for their drinks. I vigorously denied it, but was swarmed by three huge bouncers. I asked the bouncers if I could speak to them outside, and they told me I wasn't going anywhere. After a lot of intimidation, I gave them my card, and paid 106 dollars for drinks I never agreed to buy. When I spoke to one of the managers working at the door, he told me the police wouldn't care because the crime was less than 1000 dollars and I should just go get a hooker. Also, because I was dancing with the girl, that was considered proof to them I agreed to buy the drinks. Then they kicked me out and let the girls go.

I feel pretty violated. I want to spread the word to as many people as possible that the place is poison.

It's off the strip but as we drove to Vegas to really partake in the local restaurants we weren't concerned at all with proximity to the strip. Japanese food in Vegas is much more appealing than the slots! 

The hotel staff gave us a nice quiet room on the top floor and away from the noise of the after hours bar so we had a super easy nite relaxing and puppy easily slept thru the night. If I were to comment or pre-warn visitors the hotel does overwhelmingly perfume-ize the whole floor and room so for those with sensitivities to deep musky aromas beware. We actually travel with fabreeze in tow all the time, due to puppy mostly and it served us well as I'm not a real fan of perfumes.

Soon after showing my I.D. and having my hand stamped I was literally grabbed by one of the bouncers because he assumed, for some reason, that I wasn't a local and was instructed that I would have to pay the $14 cover. I quickly explained to him that since I only had my passport, I'd be happy to show him my business card. His response was to send me to talk to his supervisor out front. Once I walked away, this same doorman was overheard, by one of friends (whom he obviously didn't know I was with) that I should ""learn to read a book"".

Why a business that boasts that it caters to locals and industry people be so rude to someone who is clearly both and not being verbally combative in the least, is beyond me.

When the weather is nice, the patio here is one of the nicest spots in town to enjoy a breather from the beats and a little civilized conversation.

The one issue I have with the Artisan - and it's a big one - is that the ""dancefloor"" is also the thoroughfare to get from pretty much anywhere in the building to anywhere else in the building. So you can't dance without people having to walk around you, and you have to walk across the dance floor whenever you want to move anywhere.

36.143437,-115.169098,4,3.5,"I've not stayed in the hotel so this is solely a review for the club.

I love the Artisan...once you get in the door there is an energy and an underground vibe that hits you because of the awesome, dark decor and the pulsing techno or house. The resident DJs also DJ various other clubs on the strip during the day or night and I think they really let loose with more experimental tunes and more flavor at Artisan because its after-hours and it's unpretentious and there's no cover, no VIP guest barking orders on what music he wants the DJ to be playing. As a local, I rarely EVER go to a club on the strip because all you find is pretentiousness and VIP big dogs like ultra rich and celebrities who want the house DJ to play ""Livin' on a Prayer"" and have been known to get well known house DJs KICKED OFF THE DECKS because they have such pull because of their money. So as far as music is concerned and club experience, Artisan is where it's at for me in Las Vegas. Minor updates could be applied like making an alternate walkway to the bathrooms (if possible) instead of directly through the dancefloor. I'm usually too wasted to concentrate on little inconveniences like that so that doesn't factor into why I gave 4 stars instead of 5.

The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because they are still employing some god-awful bouncers. I'm not sure where they get these people, especially the bald white guy with the attitude, but hassling people and giving them attitude is inexcusable when more than any other club I know of in Vegas, the people attending are just looking to have a good time. There are very few meatheads, no rabble rousers. Lighten the hell up!  I'm a security professional by trade. When I say security professional, I mean I was a bodyguard for Senators and a certain President in Iraq and in Afghanistan. I have 108 armed employees under my control currently. Securing an entrance and being a doorman does not require an attitude. In fact, it can escalate problems or cause them where there are none. People are coming in to spend money and create profit for the Artisan, why adversely affect their experience and cause them to not come back? I think the management at Artisan needs to seriously take a look at the people they hire out there. A smile and a common courtesy as opposed to a glare and snarl goes a long way when someone's first impression is the doorman. 

Just some helpful advice from someone near the top of the professional security food chain;)

I hope to see you all for my birthday when I get back from Afghanistan!

36.143437,-115.169098,2,3.5,"I have mixed feeling about this place. First I will begin with the food and service 

Food/Service: I had plans to go out with some friends for a casual dinner and drinks. We made reservations at the reststaurant located inside the bar area of the hotel. When we got there we were seated in the restaurant and shortly after told that they did not have a server working that night. I would expect this to happen in a small town at 9pm on a Sunday night but not in Vegas! We were given the option of sitting at the bar to eat and we decided that it was a better idea than looking for another place to eat . When we at at the bar we had a bartender that was extremely annoyed at the fact that we were ordering food! We ordered our food and drinks and immediately after she was already wanting to give us our check so we can leave. We were sitting with a check for over priced bar food and empty stomachs. We sat next to two other people that came in way after us and they got their food immediately while we were sitting waiting and waiting for our food. Once our food got to us it was cold! It was literally one bust after another. I had the sliders which came with fries. The sliders had bacon with some sort of hickory sauce and cheese. The fries that came with the sliders we cold and frankly took my hunger away because they were so awful. 

The food menu offered at the bar included:
Chicken wings for $12.00
Basil and Sausage Flatebread for $12.00
Margarita Flat Bread for $ 9.00
""Homemade"" chili cheese fries for $9.00
Artisan Slider for $12.00 - which include fries (This is what I had and I wouldn't recommend it)
There were also a few other menu options like an Artichoke Dip that did not look very appealing.

Drinks
The price range of drinks is about how much you would pay at any night club or bar on the Strip. I had a midori sour and the price was roughly $12.00.  I usually like this drink because it is a combination of a sweet and sour. This midori sour was unlike any I have ever tasted and not in a good way. The midori sour didn't have any ""sour"" in it at all. It tasted like watered down sugar with a touch of alcohol. I was very disappointed and did not order another drink after that. 

Overall I give the service a 1.5 and if it wasn't for the amazing atmosphere of the hotel has I would never consider going back. 

Atmosphere

The atmosphere of this Boutique Hotel is AMAZING! The lighting is dim and the entire lobby and bar had lots of things to keeps your eye busy. There are little mirrors all over the ceilings with a lot of unique paintings and chandeliers. There is also a huge fountain in the middle of the lobby and different status throughout. The entire place is just beautiful and perfect for a big or small group of friends to go to. I don't recommend anything that they offer for consumption like the drinks or food but this place is so fun to be in. You can spend a good hour just looking around at all the different things they have as decorations.

ROOMS:
Although I have never stayed at any of the room here they are very reasonable in price ($32.00 was the room rate when I went) but if it's anything like the lobby or bar area I would stay there is a heart beat.

The Bar:

The Bar is open 24 hours and also has food available late into the evening.  Our party was fantastic.  Great music, awesome food and super drinks.  The next day after the party we received a report from our friend who came back to the hotel at about 3 am.  He was amazed by the line out the door and around the block to get into the bar.  He was finally allowed through the velvet ropes and up to his room after showing his room key.  When this place claims it is the number one after hours bar, it appears that the claim is true!

The Hotel:

When you walk into the lobby you are greeted by all sorts of art.  Art on the ceiling, art on the walls, art on the floor.  Unbelievable. Fun is the word that comes to mind.  We stayed in the Picasso suite on the fourth floor.  It was comfortable and roomy.  It did have some quirks like the carpet wasn't quite perfect on the floor; however, there was good water pressure and a comfy bed.  That said, our room overlooked the expressway on ramp and was, at times, extremely noisy.  Plus, in the evenings, you could hear the thumping of the music from somewhere on the property. But heck, this is Vegas.  Who needs to sleep anyway?

The Pool:

Unfortunately wasn't really open yet as we were there in March.  But it had a nice layout and looked like a place I could relax.  

The Service:

I really liked that food and drink were available just about 24/7.  A nice feature.  One downside was that since this is off the strip, getting a taxi can take a little time.  Walking from here anywhere was really not an option.  

That said, we enjoyed our stay and felt we received good value for the money.  Under the right circumstances we would certainly stay here again.

I've seen pictures on Hotels tonight and was very intrigued by them and wanted to go by and visit the hotel lobby on my next Vegas visit. Was not intending to stay there, but stayed 1 night because of the good deal on Hotels tonight. Did not know anything about the after-hours club, or the noise level. If I did I would have not chosen to stay here, as the music was overwhelming coming up thru the floors of the 4 story hotel.
Upon check in the valet asked if we stayed here before or knew about the hotel. When we said no, he told us about the club going to 8am. Apparently the only nights they do not have the after-hours club is on Monday and Tuesday, so ask for a room that is not over the club. 
We are not club people, so getting back into the hotel at night was like going thru security at the airport lol, had to speak to 2 different people to get into the lobby to get to the elevator to get to the room. 

The noise level was loud, but it was because the walls were thin and we could hear the dog in the room next door yelp and bark, the traffic outside because of the thin glass window, and the people above us sounded like they were going to come thru the floor into our room when they walked since the squeaking was so bad.
Also the hallways are loud since the floor is tiled and not carpeted. Since this hotel is an old Travelodge, so are the rooms and I took that into consideration with the thin walls and floors. Unfortuantly our A/C didn't cool the room even tho is was on the coolest setting at 60 degrees, it only cooled the room down to about 75. 

Loved the chic goth style of the hotel, but it's better for more of a drink and not to stay unless maybe you're going to the after-hours party.

It is far from the strip and is your last stop before you head to your room. It isn't ideal to get a room here unless you are completely knocked out because the music is too loud. The rooms are kind of crappy - last time I thought the fan was ready to break off because it was hanging by the wires! But they do look pretty inside. I ordered breakfast once and it wasn't the best.The pool is pretty too but small and the lounge is cool with old movies playing in the background. It is more of a club then a resort. 
One last thing, they pretty much let any style of clothing in except guys can't wear flip flops or hats (I think).",0.227057613169,28,4.38,2010-07,1,0,0,0
36.143437,-115.169098,3,3.5,"Took a staycation recently and booked a room at Artisan through my HotelsTonight app for one night for $60. When I first arrived I was a little sceptic prior to walking in. Looked really small and worn from the outside, but as soon as I walked in, my mouth dropped open and my eyes went like this O_O. Lobby is really dim-litted and with its sculptures and paintings decorated around the room, it sets this type of dark, gothic, artistic ambiance. They should probably hire a man dressed as a butler to open the doors and say, ""Goood Eeveninngg"" in a dark ominous voice to really perfect it. Definitely agree with Misty that it's very reminiscent of the Haunted Mansion. 

We checked in Sunday night and the concierge informed us they have an after-hours club that takes place in the lobby and restaurant area and will last till 7AM. I've heard about these parties on the radio and was interested in checking it out. An important note to all the young-bucks who are interested in staying... YOU MUST BE 21 TO STAY HERE. The girl who helped us told us a story that a guy pre-paid a room and couldn't end up staying because he was 20, boy.. he must of been mad :\

Well we got to our room and the hallway leading up to it reminded me a lot of those haunted houses during Halloween time. It was dark, like the rest of the hotel, and covered in over-sized portraits beautifully framed to make them look like antiques. It was lots of fun to look at and definitely a very different experience I have gotten from the other hotels in Vegas. The room is.. yes, you guessed it.. dark (by dark I mean the walls are painted like maroon..) and covered in paintings. Doesn't look much like a typical Vegas room (of course), more like my own bedroom.. if I was a mysterious art-infatuated type. Although it overall sounds really grungy, the room itself is pretty clean and it comes with a flat screen so don't assume they play to the old dark renaissance times to its full extent. 

Well sadly we didn't end up going to the party downstairs but .. it truly did go on till 7AM. If you're looking for a good night's rest on a weekend night, look elsewhere..cause it seems like the party never stops at this joint, or at least the loud music doesn't. 

Definitely wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone looking for the glitzy, glamorous, Vegas experience. But this is definitely a place to check out for its originality.",0.0736394557823,156,3.94,2010-12,20,1,5,1

The food was good. I had the filet, which was cooked as requested, not too under or overcooked. Someone in my party had the scallops, which was also cooked just right. Sides ordered were the mushrooms, which was my favorite dish, very tasty. We also got the brussel sprouts, mac and cheese, and the French fries. All were ok. Not incredibly impressive. We got the crab cakes, bruschetta and Margarita flatbread for appetizers. All good. The bruschetta would have been better if the bread wasn't hard. I prefer it when it is a little softer.

I've actually stayed there as a hotel so I'll break my review into two parts.  As a hotelit has a unique vibe. It comes out with a dark and sinister vibe, like Misti said, its like the haunted mansion. The lobby area has a lounge type area with books, and everywhere you go theres pictures. The elevator has a red light, so anytime I go to and from my room I always felt like it was a red light district. The floors/ rooms have a artistic vibe. Theres tons of paintings in the hallway and the rooms are all themed by an artist like Dali or Frieda. The amenities are atypical of any hotel, and the breakfast in the morning leaves much to be desired.

Now the fun part of the review is the nightclub/ after hours. this is one of the most fun clubs for locals.They  always have a good DJ, usually local, and a good variety Its free to get in, the dress code is lax and the party is never ending. Let me repeat, the party is never ending. I go there to party and I end up leaving and the sun is out.thats how wild things get, and you always lose track of time.

When we first got into the room, the lights wouldn't turn on.  We put the room key into the key slot that's required for the energy to turn on.  For some reason the light switch wouldn't work, you have to press the button like 5-6 times!  The bathroom look is the WORST!  It wouldn't even turn on after soo soooo many times!

The house keeping was the worst!  Worst Service ever of this place, obviously! But at 11am, they literally bang on your room and tell you have to check out now.  She did it 3 times really loud.

And let me say this...

If we hadn't have already booked rooms elsewhere for the other three nights we were there I wouldn't have left the Artisan.

The best things about the place are:

Every single member of the staff that I dealt with was very, very courteous, friendly, and helpful. I'm talking from the Valet, to the Doorman, to the Front Desk, everyone was fantastic.

This place is BEAUTIFUL. The paintings, the furniture, the design of the place... it took my breath away. It's an incredible mix of Gothic and impressionist renaissance art and design. From the statues that I wanted to take home, to the ornate black fountain in the lobby, to the wall to ceiling (yes literally, on the ceiling) art that ranged from Monet, to Dali, to Picasso, to Degas, to Van Gogh, to the wrought iron doors and wooden carvings, my inner goth girl was in heaven. Even the chapel made me wish I was getting married again just so I could use it. I have so many pictures I took of this place that it's unreal. It's really a sight to behold.

The rooms are all themed to a certain artist. We happened to get Room 219 which is a Salvador Dali room. It was gorgeous and super clean. Paintings everywhere, mirrors, a black ceiling fan, ice cold air conditioning, and wall to wall black tile bathroom were awesome. It even had an ornate wooden desk to be able to sit at, as well as a plush black velvet chair you could sink into. 

Also, I was on the second floor while they had the pounding music at the bar underneath and I barely heard a thing. I don't know if people are just being too sensitive or what, but I slept like a baby. Btw, the beds are super comfy and the linens are plush and bright white. 

Seriously, I've been to MANY hotels, including the ones I stayed at the rest of my trip and NONE of them will top my experience at the Artisan. I can't recommend it enough. I've already told everyone I know about it. I will never stay anywhere else when I'm in Vegas. It will always be the Artisan from now on.",0.224838217338,1,5.0,2013-06,0,0,1,0

-Our reservation was for a double bed. Upon arriving, all that was available was a queen. This was very disappointing. They couldn't even offer us a rollaway. One guest had to sleep on the floor.

-On Facebook, an open bar is frequently advertised from 10-11. This is an awesome thing to offer guests, but often the bartenders are nowhere to be found. They only serve one type of vodka (which is pretty good), but often they don't have this vodka present at the bar (for whatever reason). 

-Furthermore, in regard to the open bar, the bartenders seemed very annoyed that's what I was there for (pregaming). I tipped well and all, but they were not happy that I was attending for the open bar. I couldn't really understand why.

-Lastly, if you need more bottles of water or towels, I hope you're not in a hurry. It takes around 45 minutes for whatever you need to find it's way to your room.

Artisan!!! No!!! What have you done?!?!

Anyone who knows me know that I have been in love with the Artisan for the past year and a half. The amazing friends I've made, the endless dancing, leaving this place exhausted with sunglasses over my eyes... The Artisan was my home away from home. It was my motha fuckin' spot.

Returning to Vegas, I could not wait to re-enter this familiar haunt. Walking up the from the gravel lot across the street, I got an overwhelming wave of happiness and memories past came flooding back.

I got inside and it just wasn't the same. The place still has that seedy, mystical, haunted machine vibe, but the entire staff had changed. What I loved about the Artisan was that it was a place where the rift-raft were accepted. There was none of the pretense that exists on the Strip. It was a tried and true locals joint playing underground EDM. 

I was a regular here. At least 2-3x a month I'd visit. I'd meet friends and make friends inside these once sacred wall. I'm disappointed and my heart is slightly broken.

HOTEL:
The rooms are all individual and unique (hence boutique), so for that alone, kudos. The hotel in terms of Vegas standards is a 3 star. With afterhours 3-4 nights a week, you won't be getting a quiet nights sleep here. It just isn't going to happen. The rooms have comfy beds and the bathrooms are itty bitty. No tubs either. I had a suite, so it was kind of a shame, but for the sticker price, it's not a bad deal. Definitely worth checking out.

The good thing is that this bar is beautiful. The paintings never cease to keep me looking up. I love that. That and the deep leather and just the richness of the place helps to stave away the Vegas look. 

The cons are that every person who works here is pretty much rude. A very few aren't, but that's not the majority AT ALL. I get the worst service here. From sitting and waiting and waiting and waiting for a drink, to being told to move out of a section that's reserved for the tweekers and ravers that hit every night. The ones that probably contribute little to the financial success of the bar than say, a professional there for drinks in a quiet, sexy atmosphere. Ahem. Yeah, service is bad.

Next is that they serve the lowest common denominator in alcohol and beer. The choices are so shockingly bad and cheap that I have zero idea how this bar stays afloat. If I want to drink Heineken in a dark place I have a closet in my room and a fridge to store it. Except that Heineken isn't allowed in my fridge so there's that. 

This bar has appeal up until you need good service and a good drink then you're better off going to the bars on the strip. No thanks.

Being a Vegas 'local', the Artisan is known for their party atmosphere. This begins with the rule of having to be 21+ to stay here.

I am a little embarrassed to say that I had not gone to the Artisan until a few weeks ago. Once I got past the maze of industrial buildings and strip clubs and reached my destination, I couldnt figure out where the self parking was. I pulled into valet to ask where to park. The valet dude was very friendly, pointing to the gravel lot just across the street. Since he was friendly, I figured I'd just valet. I was carrying 3 dozen cupcakes and brownies for a party that I was attending there, and as soon as he saw them, he inquired about me attending the party that was being held there. I was impressed that he knew about the party, and he even knew which room it was being held at. Brownie points for him. In fact, I offered him an actual brownie, but he declined, being at work and all..

The hotel lobby is bananas! ceilings full of mirrors and turn of the century/haunted mansion/french/renaissance/dungeon decor. (picture lots of brass, blood red, gold, velvet, and dimly lit areas throughout the property. Definitely my cuppa tea! The 'dark' decor theme continued as I reached the 5th floor. The suite that we had booked was awesome. A pool table in the middle of the room, with an adjacent bedroom. There was a small sink/counter area combo that worked perfectly for a bar, and we had rearranged the furniture to accomodate a small dance floor and DJ set up. 

As other yelpers have mentioned, there are no ice machines, but we planned ahead and brought plastic buckets to fill with ice down at the bar. The bartender was very accomodating and helped scoop ice from the machine for us. We cruised around the lobby, as I couldnt get over the decor. Be sure to check out their library if you're into the whole atmosphere experience.

Ladies and gents, we partied our asses off in that sweet little suite. The whole 5th floor shook with the loudness from our DJ. This was both a plus and a creepy factor: the whole time I was there, I did not see any hotel patrons that were not part of our party. I did not see anyone at guest check in, only a valet employee and the bartender. It made me feel like I was part of a creepy chapter 2 of The Shining. LOVED IT!

Linens on the bed were clean smelling, as were the bathrooms. Got the grungy feeling on my feet after kicking my heels off and running rampant on hotel room carpet, but that can be said (and felt) at every hotel.

I don't feel good about this review - since I generally give any business the benefit of the doubt, but this particular hotel is by far the worst experience I've ever had since coming to Vegas - and I've been coming to Vegas since I was 12 years old (I'm 38 now) and I'm mortified by my time spent here in this hotel - if you choose to call this place a hotel.

The ""afterhours"" party is obnoxious, redundant, loud, and sickening.  Especially if your room is above the pool.  And by the way, the pool is dirty and small and only open until 7pm - and it's about 3 feet deep.  My bathtub is bigger. 

There is no casino.

The restaurant is never open.

And the bar is always empty.  I had to pay $5 for a ""PLASTIC"" glass of sprite from the well.  Just a sprite.  NO liquor. 

There's no fridge in the room unless you opt for a junior suite.

There are no ice machines - so be prepared to walk downstairs in a drunken stupor to ask the bartender for a bucket of ice.

The nearest casino will cost you about $10 for a taxi ride.

There are no vending machines - in case you get the ""munchies"".  And who wants to pay $8 for a bottle of water!?  Are you kidding me!?

If I could get my money back, I would.  But, I purchased my stay from ORBITZ and there are no refunds. 

The water constantly drips from the shower.  And although this hotel is 'green' - (the energy saving keycard) - it's annoying.  The lights turn off constantly.  

My ironing board was broke. 
My iron leaked water. 
The wif-fi was spotty.  
The street noise is constant and deafening.   
The elevator is slow. ONE ELEVATOR, by the way.

The art is cool but not cool enough to pay for the drama that has occurred over the last 72 hours.

I did complain and the manager upgraded my room on the first night, so the customer service was superior - I will give them that plug.  But, this HOTEL isn't first-class enough to make my stay pleasant. 

I feel bad for giving this hotel a one-star review.  Especially since I haven't checked out of my room yet.  But it's so frustrating not being able to have the VEGAS convenience of food and gambling.  

My wife is sick in bed this evening and it would be soooo gratifying to be able to purchase some seltzer and some ib profin!  Without exorbitant prices!  But, alas, this HOTEL is disappointing.  

I'm starving, dehydrated, and broke.  

This hotel could make a lot of money if the owner just put in a few slot machines, a deli, and the option for 24-hour room service.  That's all.  

I'm not sure how this hotel is making it.  They are on the fast-track to a bankrupt business. 

It's been a ghost town for the last 48 hours!  I feel bad for the valet and bar staff.  

I'm not a snob but this is THE WORST hotel in Vegas.  HANDS DOWN!  WORST!  

I don't like throwing out explanation points like this - but I'm staring at my ill wife and a watered down glass of sprite.  I can't wait to check out of this hell hole.  I 'almost' don't want to visit Vegas ever again.  And that's a sad & recent development.    

If you want the Vegas experience, fork out the extra few hundred and stay at The Mandalay.  It's by far THE BEST experience I've ever had.  I should have done that to begin with.

i was in contact with heather murray who is their event planner/manager. lets just say the most basic of things were what she helped me with. She didnt have many opinions. I made it very clear that because i live in orange county, i was very open to suggestions/recommendations with vendors. 

thursday.
 we had been exchanging emails about rehearsal times for the past 2 weeks.. she called me welcoming me which was very nice. also she wanted to confirm our 6pm rehearsal time... well our rehearsal time was for 630 which is stated in our emails. side note- i am completely stressed out at this point.. we still had to get our marriage license and meet with the dj.. 
anyway i told her no its at 630 and she said she had another appointment and ""would try to figure it out.."" then later texts me back to say sorry because she dbl checked her email and i was right! duh! why are you adding stress to this day.. you are supposed to be making it easier! many things like this happened. 

anyway so the rest of the evening went pretty well... heather was a lil frustrated because most of the wedding party was buzzed and it was hard to get people to shut up.. but hey its vegas! anyway.. so it was told to me that we could use the iPod hook up outside for the ceremony.. micheal (manager?)  was in charge of hitting next and fading out music during the ceremony... the plug in for iPod was super sensitive and kept making the music cut out.. after the 4th time running through we got it all figured out and he said if we used an ipad we wouldn't have these problems because it could sit on the table..done i did that assuming it would be perfect... lets just say on the day of we got through the forst 3 songs easy and when the last song that needed to play as we walked out after our vows.. iit skipped and went quiet for like 15-20 seconds while we stood up at the alter.. totally awkward. remind me how hard it is to press play? k fast forward to rehearsal.. i talk to heather & michael.. i find out heather will only be by the wedding for a couple minutes.. she is putting someone i have never met in charge of my entire wedding.. and basically this poor lady has to only go by a sheet of paper heather has drawn up for her. refer back to rehearsal time mistake and so many more little mistakes like spelling my first/last name wrong on official contracts.. i mean im paying you guys over $15,000 and pretty much sold out your hotel... can u spell my name right?

 wedding day!
so she brings the ipad down to have pre ceremony music.  we head downstairs which she walked us down to make sure we didnt run into the guys.. think thats the last time i saw her. after the ceremony is when i lost my shit. were in the lobby taking pictures &i keep seeing all the guests running to the main bar when there is a bar in the reception area that we payed for (soft bar) 3 hours. it shoud have started right away for cocktail hour!  i stressed to heather over all those months that i wanted the guests ushered into the reception area to take photos& get drinks! well there was no structure whatsoever because this chick that was ""running"" my wedding had no clue what was going on! on top of that... they only had a cash bar so everyone was running to the main bar to get their drinks (where they all had been hanging out the whole weekend!$$$) because no one told them where to go! also a friend of mine put 500 bucks toward the bar because they were charging people! ps.. it was 35 bucks a person for 3 hours plus a 29.1 percent tax/gratuity... also i have friends that do not drink and we still had to pay for them as drinkers including his lil sister who is only 19. another quick side note.. they dont have non alcoholic beer so i went and bought some to put behind the bar... no idea if they charged my friends for those but i wouldnt be surprised since its completely unorganized. 

1 more thing..  a mnth before the wedding we had a tasting with heather that went great.. during this time i asked her about saturday night in the masterpiece suite because wanted to book it. she said it was available & got me the discounted rate for $249  so i booked the room after the tasting which came to $290.00. we partyed pretty late in the afterhours downstairs after wedding..it was about 11am when i heard a knock on our door the morning after our wedding. the maid asked me if i was checking out.. i said no i booked for another night.she said ok &got on her walky talky.. i  started getting ready for the pool party  about 40 minutes later, another knock on the door &its 2 security guys. one  guy said wehe said they were told i had ""refused to leave the room"" and needed to move across the hall asap! wtf! so we had to move ALL of our wedding stuff (dress,gifts,luggage) with 30 friends waiting in lobby. we were pissed.",0.111912598475,10,4.55,2010-03,5,0,3,1

You now need your room card to operate the elevators to go up to the floors, and you also need it to operate the lights/AC in the unit.  We liked that added security feature. Front desk/Valet staff was friendly as well, they made the whole arrival/check-out process a breeze.

What we didn't like:
1) The Mood restaurant used to be open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Now it's only open from 5pm-midnight and there really aren't any convenient places to go to get breakfast food if you just want to relax in your room and eat.
2) In our room, the sofa/love seat in front of the bed had a broken leg, and the broken leg was sticking out to the point where I tripped on it the next morning (I didn't notice it upon check-in, we were so tired we just went straight to bed.)  Apparently the staff hasn't been checking up on this because the front desk was surprised when I told them.  I would think that something that obvious would be noticeable to the cleaning crew. Also, the sink in the bathroom was wobbly to the point where it knocked into the wall while leaning against it to brush your teeth/wash your face.  Not a huge problem, but it was somewhat annoying.  
3) (The major issue) All night we felt itchy and we felt like something was crawling on us in the bed, but when we would look around we wouldn't find anything.  The next morning, however, I woke up to two small roach-like insects running around on the bed. Needless to say we just grabbed our belongings and checked out. I took photos of them if management would like to see, but I won't post them. The room/hotel didn't look ""dirty"" even with these minor problems.  They may have come in from outside or through the window...but nonetheless it was a little unsettling.

We would continue to stay here when we come to Vegas (which isn't often) simply because of the courteous staff (our bartender was Britney and she was great) and the environment.  We ate dinner when we arrived, and the food was great, and the waiter was very attentive.  We can't complain about that experience at all. We would just like to see the rooms checked over a little more thoroughly in the future. Also, we would like to see an after-hours snack bar or even chips/soda for guests who want to purchase snacks when the restaurant isn't open.  I know the bar is open 24 hours, so maybe it could be located in there?

36.143437,-115.169098,4,3.5,"I have meant to review this place for a while, I've been about a dozen times. I havent been in a while (6 months or so) If things have changed since then, (like staff, I have no complaints there but it may be outdated)

This is where we stay when we go for a weekend. Normally when we go for longer than that we stay elsewhere, because it's normally for business and sleep is more important than fun.

It's Loud. I'm OK with that. You should know about this is advance and not complain. I'm ok with the shabby thing and the darkness and the wait for the car and all of that.

I LOVE that the rooms arent a million miles from the front door, I love that its not a casino, I love the paintings and the themes. I love all that artsy stuff. I love that we were never pointed to some big place to go eat, it was always something cool and funky. If you ask for an opinion about where to go and tell them off the beaten path, they give you the real skinny.

Reading other people's reviews, I realize that my memories are better than the real thing. But I am always happy after I've stayed, so my issues are generally small and easily taken care of.

To tell the truth I am a little bummed about there no longer being breakfast here, it was amazing and I really liked the convenience.

I've seen complaints about waiting for room service, I'm never in a hurry when I ask for room service so this never bothered me. If it were pressing, I would go out and get whatever I needed myself. I've never been overly dependant on room service, no matter where I stay.

Free Porn, on a loop, but still, free porn. Friendly staff (as I remember it, but again, its been a while) Champagne was warm when we got, everytime, but it was FREE to begin with and I didn't really expect much for it.

My annoyances stem from, no ice machine, having to go all the way down to the bar to get ice is frustrating at 2am. Especially when your not there to party, your not dressed up and you just want a cold drink. Who brings their ID to an Ice machine? Well, you will here because you won't get in that late at night, even for ice, without it. (though maybe you could if you flirt with the guards...)

People have kicked my door, thinking it was the party across the hall. I don't blame the hotel for that, or that there was a party there, but I do have a complaint about the parties on the hotel room floors that spill into the hall, especially when they leave the doors to their rooms open. Also I'm not a pot smoker, if partiers choose to partake, that's their business, but don't smoke it in the halls. Have more respect. 

I don't like the marshmello beds, We've found that the king beds are much more comfortable for us as a couple when we go. I only ever got doubles in the first place so we would have more lounging room.

Last but not least, its kind of a pain to get to, we get lost on our way in almost everytime and the first 2 times it really annoyed us since it was very late and we were tired to begin with.

Its a little run down, every room doesnt have a fridge, you have to wait to get your car, but I've never had the staff not follow through on promises made. 

I'd go again. I don't know why people have trouble with the neighborhood or whatever.

We booked a room here for two nights when we drove out to run the rock and roll half marathon. Usually we stay further off strip (Green Valley, the M) but wanted to be a bit closer this time for convenience and they had super reasonable room rates so we took a chance.

I was well aware of the after hours loudness situation so when we checked in, I mentioned we'd appreciate a quite-ish room if at all possible and were put on the 5th floor. Speaking of check in, the girl working the desk was incredibly friendly and awesome. Unfortunately, I don't remember her name but, Girl who used to work at the hotel in Santana Row - you were wonderful! The decor throughout the lobby and in the room is unique and interesting. A nice touch of personality in a city full of homogeneous hotels. 

So, why the 3 stars you ask? We slept terribly. It actually had NOTHING to do with the after hours club.

In general I'm a fairly light sleeper but I was awoken close to once an hour because something loud was happening.

I would for sure go here for a drink in the lounge to show someone the cool decor, but even if you're having a Vegas party trip you want to nap quietly for a few hours at some point of the day or night and the street noise was too consistent to allow for resting, so I personally wouldn't stay here again.",0.09875,193,3.92,2008-01,5,0,1,0

Drive up is cute with nice first appearance, although I wasn't greeted by anyone, which was my first clue that something was amiss. The lobby is dark and interesting. Very quiet and cool with floor to ceiling (literally!) art -- but the emphasis here is on quantity, not quality - just a bunch of junk really. Still I appreciated what they were putting forth and thought it was kitsch and fun. Front desk was nice enough, but could have been warmer. They told me that they couldn't let me pay the additional fee for early check-in because they were sold out the night before. Now...I was checking in on a Tuesday, which meant they were sold out on a Monday. A hem.....when I tell you there was not a SOUL in this hotel I kid you not. I saw one couple only the entire time I was there, so I suspect what they were saying was that they bring their staff in to clean up after the weekend on Monday and Tuesday and just take their time???? It was strange. I took the elevator to my room and the hallway just had the strangest, scariest fung shui - can't explain it. It was like blood was gonna start dripping from the walls any minute. Moving on to the room......This is where the magic really dies. Room color is all wrong and they carried the ""we found a bunch of junk and stuck it on the walls"" motif to the max in my room. Lampshade was busted! Popcorn ceilings! Cheap, ugly ceiling fan that was about a second from flying off into the abyss! Terrible mattress and pillows! I won't even get into the pool area - suffice it to say the pictures were snapped on the day it was opened. 

So, what's the upside? The hotel is fun and funky. I suppose if you're a 20-something and here for the club which is from what I heard definitely happening on the weekends, this is the perfect choice for stumbling to your room at 4:00 am. But if you're a grown up looking for a safe, comfortable, convenient choice in Vegas...pass on Artisan.",0.133975694444,37,3.16,2006-11,4,0,1,0

Usually my Saphire martini's cost about $15.  In this case it was $15 plus ""$3 martini bump""  The wine was also $15 for average red.  In addition, I asked for water and was charged $6 for bottled water.   the martini was so bad I think it's fairly unlikely that bottle actually had saphire in it.  I had one sip and about gagged.  Ate the olives and left the gin!

After about 15 minutes they turned on music and disco-like lights and horrible music with way too much base that gave me an instant headache.  the few people left in the bar left.  My friend and I left shortly thereafter.

The restaurant was closed.  The crowd was non-existant.  Rip-off drinks.  Horrible music and very confused about who they are!  (Disco at a dark, trying to be sexy bar?  blech)

Also, the hallways and walls are littered with 18th century artwork and earlier. I'm pretty sure they're the originals. Which makes me wonder, why, with all the drug addicts around, they don't give the Mona Lisa some security? 

I have to say, I'm really looking forward to returning to The Artisan one day. But, that day won't be until I am fully deaf (and that day could be today!).

I'll just write my experience since all else is mentioned already. 
- i find the hotel very pretty and awesome, but also very dark. 
- our room, though far away from the after hours nightclub - is right above the pool. 
they play music by the pool at all hours of the day, even when there is not a soul out there for hours on end. doesn't make sense to me. its repetitive and annoying. i would prefer quiet - but then again, i would just hear the highway a lot more. 
- our room also didn't have an electrical socket by the bed or the desk for the computer. it took me 3 days, but i finally got 2 extension cords. 
- the staff is mainly very nice and helpful. 
- the pool party was fun, but the music was too loud, with ear plugs. nobody was dancing, so i asked the manager to turn it down a bit, but he said that if more people come, it needs to be this loud so they know its a party. i said that when people are dancing or even standing, its a party. when everyone there (10 people) are laying down - its not a party and i don't  believe i need to go deaf while wearing earplugs. just doesn't make any sense to me. i know i'm older now... 37... but still. 
- the club - pretty as everything is here, but also too loud. hurts my ears with ear plugs. also not the music i like to dance to, so essentially i just walked out after less than 5 minutes. 
- i don't know if it says this anywhere, but this place is essentially a swingers hotel - so anything goes pretty much anywhere. i have no issues with that, on the contrary, but if you do - stay elsewhere. 
- there is not breakfast to be had unless you walk a mile away. 
- no coffee / tea - even though they did prepare it for me with a special request. 
- restaurant is only open friday and saturday. but if there's an event happening at the bar - then no food for you. 
- i think it would be an awesome place for a photo shoots of several kinds. 

summary - after you get used to the shortcomings, and the shitty music, its nice and most of all unique. but i have experienced better. 

the key is to know what to expect.

Ps - i am again stuck in the lobby right now because the elevator key again will not take me upstairs. 90% of the time that i have attempted to go upstairs in the elevator i needed to go get a new card key that still would not always work.

I decided to go with the 9$ plate of beef kabobs ( steak , onions , peppers, how could you go wrong ? ) After about 20-25 min on waiting on a ""10 min order"" I was brought this plate of tiny little pieces of steak on a stick each one had  one onion slice and one square of a cold green pepper . There was also a side of sauce that fell before I ever saw the plate but the waitress wouldn't mind getting me another sauce ""if I really wanted her to""....

The BBQ pork (char siu) and chicken is decent also. I prefer fatty char siu... the tastiest part of the char siu =P",0.0661172161172,115,3.34,2008-03,2,0,0,0

I have a pretty much constant craving for asian noodle soup, so we decided to go to Chinatown, since my Vegas resident friend said that it was the ONLY place to get asian food.  

We randomly drove down the street and saw this place...""Cafe NOODLE...blah blah blah.""  That was the place for me!  It was around midnight, and we were dressed up in very small pieces of clothing, but the waiters still made us feel comfortable.  He pointed us to the Beef Brisket & Egg Noodle Soup, so that's what we got (me without wontons and my friend with wontons).  

We weren't expecting much...after all....we just found any place with noodle soup and got whatever was suggested. But MAN...it was GOOOOOODDDDD!!!!!!! The broth....beefy goodness without feeling overwhelmed by the beefiness.  The noodles were JUST the right texture  to complement the beefy broth.  And there were HUGE chunks of beef, the kinf that breaks apart easily and it attached to a huge piece of tendon/fat.  I know it's bad, but i've always specifically loved those fatty/tendony pieces of meat.  I got like....10 huge pieces in that little bowl!!!   It was...to die for.  So good, that we both ate the whole thing, were so full that we wanted to sleep, and we decided to go home instead of go clubbing. hahaha.  Any food that can do that to a couple of club girls MUST be amazing.

The menu is extensive and has standard Chinese fare plus many authentic dishes. The sesame chicken is great. I always order the honey shrimp. Be forewarned though, that Cafe Noodle's honey shrimp might have more of the sweet mayo than usual. But the shrimps are large, which I like. Also, their duck is fantastic, as well as their fried bass. Also, try their pan fried seafood chow mein. I love my noodles extra crispy, and they make it just right. It is amazing.

Salt and pepper fish- I love it! Ive tried it at other places and did not like it! It actually has flavor here! Eat it before it gets soggy though or it won't taste as good!
Seafood panfried noodle- Great flavor, one of my favorites here. But it could've used a little bit more sauce and more seafood!
BBQ duck and pork- The guy ordered this and he loves the BBQ duck but mentioned that the pork was a wee dry. 
Red bean with crushed ice drink- It was ok, nothing to get excited about. I guess it could've been a bit sweeter.

The portions are decent and prices are somewhat reasonable. Each dish cost over 10 bucks. They do offer lunch and late night specials though so prices then are cheaper.
The service was actually pretty good. I guess because we're regulars here and it wasn't as busy at the time. Overall, it was money well-spent.",0.220486111111,74,3.91,2011-04,1,0,2,1

36.125908,-115.197904,4,3.5,"A three hour walking exploration of Las Vegas' Chinatown culminated with a large and delicious lunch here.  Relying once again on the ratings of Las Vegas Yelpers I decided to check out this spacious restaurant along Spring Mountain Road.

It was like stepping into a restaurant back home again as a lady greeted me in Cantonese and asked me how many.  A single index finger answered that question as I was escorted to my table.  Judging by their conversation two gentlemen seated beside me on their lunch break seemed to really like this place.  Honestly I don't eavesdrop but sometimes when you're sitting there reading your cell phone you hear things.

The menu being clumsy and tattered was definitely a symbol as to the popularity of the place.  The prices on the other hand were about double what I would pay in San Francisco, but I usually keep an open mind on that being that things are rarely as good as they are at home.

Noodles or Chinese barbecue?  Not having steamed rice for nearly a week the Chinese in me went with the latter in selecting the rice plate with two BBQ meats.  Roast Duck was definitely going to be my first choice, but it was the recent review of a San Francisco Yelp friend who wrote about a San Francisco deli with very good Soy Sauce Chicken that influenced me into trying my second choice.  I hadn't had soy sauce chicken all year so that's what I picked to go beside my duck.

Not sure about portion size I selected the Crispy Fried Tofu appetizer as well.

The tofu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L6qd3x0bHymyxub9dF7lIA?select=2qOeThevkuoRKc9Enk6mSQ) arrived first.  The eight squares of crispy, golden fried silken tofu on a bed of shredded lettuce served with a simple soy sauce infused with chopped, fresh jalapeno was simple and fabulous.  The taste was very clean and very fresh without a hint of frying oil.

When I saw my rice plate (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L6qd3x0bHymyxub9dF7lIA?select=8UiNNR3cVaxzUVHi3UoCDw) I knew right away I couldn't finish it.  Not only was the steamed rice piled high, but so were the meats.  I knew I'd end up concentrating on the meat since I wasn't about to carry leftovers back to my hotel room.  The drippings from the roast duck mixed into the rice was so good though it was hard not to eat all the rice.  Both of the meats were cooked well.  The chicken had good flavor but the meat was a bit thin and a bit chewy.  The duck was actually meatier than the chicken, and I definitely enjoyed the flavor more.

My sensitivity to MSG didn't come into play.  It's hard to imagine Chinese style BBQ without MSG, but since I couldn't detect any I'd have to say this place did it right.  The health score of ""A"" was quite reassuring too.  That's something I don't see that often in San Francisco!",0.106157796452,972,4.0,2006-11,150,20,23,23

They got varies special deals going on at this place, most traditional one is the night snack after 10pm, then there is the afternoon tea specials, and I think they also got something for lunch as well.  The best thing I like about this place is Chinese comfort food.  I never miss a chance to get their flat or egg noodles soups, usually Wonton Beef Stew or Dumpling Noodles.  Stir fried noodles were just as good.

Congee and BBQ were decent as well.  Rice plates were another thing I get every now and then, notably Curry Beef Stew Rice and Minced Beef with Egg Rice.  For regular dishes, I was not such big fan about them.  They prepared them decent enough compared to ones I had in my home state.  The cod dish seems to be pretty good deal at night snack hours.  They have off menu items such as oysters upon request.

In Cantonese, their name is pronounced ""Luk Ding Gei"", which had nothing to do with Cafe Noodle and Chinese Barbeque.  Since most of the places suck in the Chinatown Plaza, this place is the closest place being decent near that area.",0.13246031746,574,3.44,2009-11,21,1,1,1

Just put down a dollar at least. My boyfriend also having his dad in the same industry he taught him the same exact thing..

When the waiters/waitresses gives us the check we pay the bill first and then place down the tip on the table before we leave the restaurant. I guess one of the waitress recognizes us and one day comes to us while handing us the receipt she has the nerve to tell us that we don't tip or that her other co-workers tells her that we don't like to tip. 
So when she gives us the bill she asks us 
""Do you guys not like to tip because the service is bad?"" 
And then we answered
""No, we always tip. Even if the service was bad we tip.""

Then after that little conversation we had, she backed off and didn't say a word. When we were about to leave I told my boyfriend to only leave a dollar on the damn table. They didn't deserve any more than a dollar because they had the damn nerve to talk to us about tips.

That was how I felt about the economy back in 2011. Vegas has definitely recovered a lot from the dismal lows, but not really back to what it was before the crash.  So I continue to seek out decent restaurants that is budget friendly, and Café Noodle & Chinese Barbeque continues to be near the top of my list for curing hunger on a tight budget.

Like many other Yelpers have mentioned, the restaurant is not the cleanest.  Even after clearing a recently vacated table and sanitizing it, it still feels not quite clean. Maybe it is that lingering thin film of grease or they simply needed to use a cleaner rag to clean the tables.  Well, at least the utensils and tea cups are clean.

Anyway, I ended up here at Cafe Noodle and Chinese Barbeque, a restaurant that I have walked past numerous times to other businesses in this super busy plaza with the ridiculously inadequate parking spaces. However, the American name is completely foreign to me, and to locate it I had to look up the driving direction.  The place was relatively crowded at 11pm on a Tuesday night, and pretty much every patron was Asians.  I immediately sensed a good vibe that this place must be at least decent.

After looking over the menu, I opted for the Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings appetizer (tasty but on the greasy side, occasionally not very flavorful due to insufficient amount of ""salt & pepper"") and the Pan Fried Noodles with Beef and Vegetable (very large portion and pretty flavorful).  The food is not high end, but for the prices they are charging you, it is well worth it.  That was from my very first visit back in 2011, and the incomplete review draft sat and sat and sat some more until now.

So two years have gone by and several visits later (both dine-in and take-out), my impression remained roughly the same.  Service for the most part is their weak point.  Not the friendliest or most attentive, but occasionally you will get a waiter that stepped up his game (a refreshing change). Then there are times when you end up standing there for 5 minutes wanting to place an order and be completely ignored by the lady behind the counter and ultimately walk out and head across the street to another near 24/7 Chinese restaurant that is just as good, if not better.

The food at great value is what keeps me coming back once I get over their latest service mishaps. 
What I do recommend here:
* 2 BBQ Items Combo on Rice (I usually get their BBQ Duck and Soya Chicken) - it will set up back $8.75
* Spicy Eggplant Hot Pot - one of my favorites
* Salted Fish & Chicken Fried Rice - I usually get this to go plus something else. Slightly adventurous due to the salted fish.
* Any of their Pan Fried Flat Rice Noodle dishes - but sometimes it is a little greasy, so drink plenty of hot tea!
* Crispy Fried Chicken (all day special dine-in only offer for $5.95 each) - that is a very sweet and filling deal!

From 3PM to 5PM, they have a limited ""High Tea"" menu, customers get a free HK style milk tea or coffee (hot or cold) along with your order. Not an awesome promo, but if you have to pay for said complimentary beverage it will cost you $2.50.  

NOTE: In their recent Chinese newspaper ads, they have all day specials from $4.95 to $7.95, but I have never tested that during normal dinner time.

Minimum for credit card use is $15, so order enough or bring cash.

My husband, the chef, eats here weekly with the boys from the kitchen and a few chef buddies from around town...They always sit in Ben's section - he makes great recommendations when Chef is feeling like having more than #11 (pho) and some orange chicken (hey it's usually 2am so he's entitled to be a creature of habit of sorts...).  Since I work more normal hours, I rarely meet him -- but when I can, it's always a treat...

Last night, since I had the day off today, we went -- and it was yummy!  

Ben was there and in addition to my usual can't miss dish (the salt and pepper calamari -- with jalapeno, green onions and crispy garlic), he suggested the Vietnamese salad with chicken -- it was brilliant!  Crispy cabbage, crunchy crushed peanuts, fried shallot rings, crispy garlic , tender pulled chicken, cilantro and a miso/ginger dressing that was perfect -- I love salads that are balanced in flavor, texture and acidity... he said they make it with duck, beef, shrimp, calamari, just about every protein they have in house...  

Then he suggested we try the lamb -- I know...lamb at Pho?  It was phenomenal -- tender lamb chops with Chinese spices, grilled to medium rare...over a cold, crispy romaine salad -- again another great dressing -- not sure about ingredients in this one though...

Then he told us they had venison...but by the time he got back with sauces it was 86d, so he ordered the beef for us.  Out came a large, smoking hot black river rock -- a plate of sliced beef, with chunks of butter and limes.   He melted the butter on the stone, then put the beef on it and we cooked it to our degree of doneness -- squeeze of lime -- a dip in the sauce, and it was tender and delicious and took seconds.   That rock wasn't going to cool down anytime soon...

Last night, the spring rolls weren't that great, and the dumplings were tough -- so I'll avoid them next time.  Hey, I can't eat everything...so it's fine with me -- but I'm still looking for Vegas' best potstickers... 

But for a chef to come, and when he's in the mood, for the experience to be totally different -- that many think is just same ol, same ol --  and for us to be treated like royalty (uh, we're not Asian...), is a real treat.

Okay, first off... as a teenager, I lived in San Jose CA - a city which has a ton of Vietnamese gangsters... and since I was always looking to get ""hookups"" on car parts, I ended up meeting and befriending alot of the aforementioned Vietnamese gangsters. Those guys ALWAYS used to take me to the best pho spots, so I'm no pho newbie.

I decided to try out Pho Kim Long with one of my boys right before he got married in Vegas, because it was quick, inexpensive, and let's face it, the name of the restaurant is awesome! Funny as hell!

After taking some quick Myspace pics by the sign outside, we ventured in the restaurant and ordered our food. My homie ordered Pho Dac Biet, and I ordered Pho Tai, which is my favorite because I love the thin, rare, red slices of steak (tai) that they throw on top of your steaming soup with hot rice noodles. 

As we waited for our food, I did my standard Vietnamese restaurant ritual of thoroughly wiping down my chopsticks and little condiment dishes with hot tea and napkins. You can never be too careful, especially since Pho Kim Long is located conveniently next to a platform shoes store for strippers.

The service was pretty good, I appreciated the fact that the waiter made an extra effort to hold our pho bowls on the outside! =) I've been to pho places before where they grab the bowl with their thumb on top, and the other fingers below the bowl... but I hate that, cause the soup splashes around, and the waiter's thumb often times goes into the soup! Aw heyllll NO!

The broth at Pho Kim Long was just ""aiight"" but I guess not bad for Las Vegas... I dont expect Vegas to have top quality pho anyways. Let's face it, people go to Vegas for buffets, gambling, parties, drinking, lap dances, and drive through weddings. Not pho.

My luck that the Sunday I choose to come in, they weren't offering it. We still sat down for dinner and this is what we got: 

* Hu Tieu Hoac Mi Bo Kho (Beef Stew Egg Noodle) - $7.95: The Big F enjoyed his noodle soup.  I was too busy with my plate to eat much of his.

* Dau Dua Xao XO Sauce (Stir fried String Beans with XO Sauce) - $9.95: Tasty string beans, a bit on the pricey side though.  A nice spice kick as well.

* Com Ga Hai Nam (Hai Nam Style Chicken with Seasoned Rice) $8.50: I've always liked Hainamese chicken since my friend's mom made it for me, along with the seasoned rice.  It's good here, but definitely not as good as my friend's mom's version.

Pho Kim Long II is a huge restaurant with lots of big tables for large parties.  A great place for families to eat and friends to gather after a late night.  Their menu is pretty extensive so there's plenty of choices for everyone.  And portions seem pretty decent-sized too.  (I wish they would get a bigger fish tank though because there are way too many fish in that tiny thing up front!)

From this experience, I give it a FOUR stars.

I love Hot N Juicy Crawfish up the road, and I definitely believe in some healthy competition.  So, last Friday we decided to finally check out their crawfish and see if it's worthy.

We decided to start off with two pounds and see where we went for there.     We noticed a neighboring table with their order of crawfish and was definitely excited.  It came in a large bowl with red potatoes, corn on the cob and sausage.  They also brought extra bowls for the shells and a plate for us to eat on.  The Big F requested limes, salt and pepper to make a dipping concoction.

I dove right in and noticed the big difference...the crawfish was not fresh.  It was old or way overcooked.  The tail meat didn't come off the shell easily and was broken up.  I thought it was just the first one and continued eating.  Unfortunately, this wasn't the case.  There was little to no head juice either, which was very disappointing to me.  The Big F was easily disgusted with the crawfish and we were glad that we only ordered two pounds to start.  (We usually go for two pounds each!)  The corn, potatoes, and sausage were good though, but it didn't make up for the bad crawfish.  Since it comes in a bowl, there's no sauce on the bottom for you to dip your crawfish in after you shell it.  No bibs were provided, which explains all the stains on my shirt.

When I'm craving crawfish, I'll drive up the road and spring the extra cash over at Hot N Juicy.

For this experience, I give it a TWO stars.

Overall, a four stars for their Vietnamese food, and a two stars for their bad crawfish.  I'm giving Pho Kim Long II a THREE star.

The food came out SUPER FAST.  I guess for Pho it doesn't take long, but they must have a batch of egg rolls ready to go every second.  They immediately brought the egg rolls out and they were piping hot.  I thought they were good but nothing too special.  

They also speak Mandarin here.  The server was listening on our conversation I guess and started to talk to us.  It took me a while to decide what to order.  My family all got a bowl of Pho.  The soup was okay.  Same thing, nothing special but not bad.  The portions here are smaller than what we get in Los Angeles or Orange County.

Eventually I decided to order the French Style Steak.  It was flavorful, but nothing that I would write home about.  Apparently I would write on Yelp about though.  =9 It was alright.  A little bit on the expensive side.

Overall the meal was decent.  They had HUGE signs of Live Crawfish posted everywhere and when we asked they said they didn't have it.  They really should have taken the banner and signs down.

I usually get the combination, of tripe, tendon, and the rare beef . Lastly, the quality of, what I call the extras, i.e. Thai basil, white onions, bean sprouts, jalapenos, &etc. 

The second dish I usually judge a Pho joint is by the quality of the spring rolls. Now, I've been to many places where the spring roll just plain sucked! It's hard to find a place that has all the elements of a good spring roll. i.e. the shrimp, not too over cooked. The pork, is it flavorful? Is the vegetables mushy? and the overall quality of the flavor, not too much vinegar, a slight touch of mirin, and of course the quality of the peanut sauce. Makes me hungry as I write this! This place hit all the mark! 

Now, let me say this, when a place is called Pho Kim Long...Pho soup is the way to go! Enjoy what they are known for! With that being said, the bowls of delectable Pho has to be one of the better ones in Vegas. It's not to say that the Banh Mi sandwiches are not bad, to be exact, it's actually pretty good! 

Service is very prompted, friendly, and professional! Nothing negative to say about it at all!

Ok, so it was funny for me for the first few times I said it..... 

The Pho here is pretty darn close to what I had in Vietnam, I mean it is just broth, noodles, and beef... but here you can tell their broth sits in kettles like they do at Pho 999s in HCMC. They don't give you as much beef as they do in viet nam, but it's still really really good. Can't say much for service, but food A+. 

Here at Pho Kim Long (^,^ he he he) it's almost a mixture of Vietnamese, Chinese and Thai with their dishes which makes it better than just a Pho house. 

Another plus is they're open 24 hours, which is probably why they're broth is so good.

So if you got a hankerin for some soup that's not heavy, but will fill your belly, come here to Pho Kim Long II and enjoy a bowl of Pho, hot and sour or wonton soup.",0.240340909091,674,3.62,2008-03,43,3,3,1

Before the 2 expansions, It was a excellent, hole-in-the-wall vietnamese restaurant. It was all the rave in town, constantly packed and everything about it was great. Great tasting hot broth and fresh vegetables and noodles. 

Then, the expansion. It seems that all the owner is thinking about now is maximizing profit. Such is apparent by the reduction in overall quality and waitstaff. Pho broth is bland, food is overpriced in accordance to the price and the service is negligible. I do have to say however their Chinese food isn't half bad. Although I'd rather go to K.J. Kitchen for that.

     The dining room is buddhist-like temple  theme which is more of a cross between Chinese and Vietnamese.  There are lots of buddha figurines in different sizes.  The fresh water fish tank is nice with expensive variety of fishes. The plants need to be taken care of because they are covered with dust.  The restroom needs to be clean because toilet paper are all over the floor.  By the way they haven't upkept since the remodeling.  The place needs better ventilation because I can smell lot of pho flavors when first entered.  
     The beef noodle soup here is reasonable.  First, the soup come out really fast.  The broth has a distinct cinnamon flavor, which is typical.  I prefer a balance flavor broth.  The price for the beef noodle soup is fair.  The seafood soup here is overpriced because the content in the soup are 3 pieces of shrimp, 2 fishballs, 3 slices of cuttlefish, and egg noodle in a blanched broth.  The BBQ duck is tasty which has a balance flavor of crispy skin, duck with fair amount of meat,  and good price.
     The service is unpredictable.  They have all male servers with a serious look on their faces most of the time.  You have to ask for service. One upswing is  they give you the right utensil for your needs.  The 17% gratuity is added with five or more in your party.  Since there is not much service that seems rediculous.

why this place sucks more in service is because they are really rude and they get angry when you say you're going to ""share a bowl"". excuse me for buying a jumbo size pho and wanting to share with my bf. jeez. another annoying thing is they grab your bowls off the table when you're still in the middle of eating. it's really rude that they just ""assume"" that you're done with your food just because you're sitting and talking with your other guests at the table.

The pho noodles are pretty good, though I have had better. Regardless of this little fact this place hits the spot when you have a very late night in Sin City. There's just something about a hot bowl of pho when you are very drunk in Vegas.

The egg rolls are very good. Crunchy and tasty, the sauce on the other hand it's not the best for me, but I'm sure someone out there will love it.

This place always seems to have a line during it's late night operations. Which is understandable, considering that the waiting staff is down to either 1 or 2 people and they are running around like mad to cater to 9-12 different tables with each having a party of 3-7.

But seriously, I really love exploring the local side of Vegas.  This was definitely one of them, although I felt most of the people inside were all tipsy from the night earlier.  I was very excited to see that this was 24 hours because pho is my late night choice for food.

Everytime I try a pho place I usually get their combo pho.  In this case, for about $7.99 I got a medium sized bowl of pho with some meat in it.  I wish the bowl was larger, and that the broth would have more flavor to that.  In my opinion, it was a bit plain.  However, the servers here were very nice, and got us our food right away after ordering.

I would come back to try some of the non pho items on the menu, which looked plentiful.  Four stars for being opened 24 hours and catering to the needs of drunk tourists and friendly locals.

36.126177,-115.193971,1,3.5,"This is an extremely popular strip mall joint that always seems to have a flow of traffic. Apparently a lot of out-of-towners and, believe it or not, a haven for for Chinese Barbies ( blonde Chinese girls in platforms a la Gene Simmons, replete with facial piercings, inflated flotational devices pasted to their chests, and a bevy of poorly placed tattoos ). Then there's the faux Elvis gangster wannabes right out of a Hollywood Chinatown movie ( think skinny punks from Big Trouble in Little China ). And of course there's the old Chinese Patriarch treating his seemingly bored and only slightly hostile family to a lunch before everyone hops into pops Mercedes and hits the mall. 

The biggest thing one notices when one walks in is the din. It sounds like they are playing three Kung Fu movies simultaneously while hosting the Beijing Circus. Much like a punk concert, one needs virtually shout to talk to the person right next to you. 

I do give credit to the wait staff that is running around, No, not like a Chinese Fire Drill, more like a fairly efficient food version of a zany Marx Brother routine. We had two waiters and two random people filling our waters up. We even had the hostess offer to fill them up once. 

About the food: it arrives quickly and is generously proportioned. We did bring the teen with us so of course they gave us each three pieces of silverware. Hah! Jokes on them, he used the chopsticks. Except on the non-sticky rice dish. But whomever designed the seating: to be shot on sight would be too generous. Better yet, make them eat here a whole week in a row. That'll do'em in! 

The spicy hot fish pot is neither hot nor spicy, but IS chock full of bones, and what I thought were hard pieces of either raisins or spices were actually bits of hardened meat that didn't seem to have soaked in the broth long enough to become palatable. Think chicklets in a bowl of stew. And I think they replaced the catfish with carp at one point. 

The Shrimp in Black Bean sauce was actually somewhat tasty except for the under cooking of the bell peppers. I know what you are thinking: bell peppers!, yes, bell peppers. This cuisine is a mishmash of Amerasian dishes neither authentic nor original. But the black beans added a nice touch. If only there was more of them to hide the undercooked shrimp. Thank goodness for the chunk of minute rice and really nice onion. 

We also had a rice dish that was at once so unmemorable and fake yellow that I've forgotten all that was in it. But my head, a day later, tells me it was chockful of MSG. And if it wasn't for the MSG, there would be a total lack of flavor in all the dishes. 

I went here following a positive review from the attorney and food critic John Curtas. I'm thinking on suing the guy. I think he must have meant that the visual and cultural experience is worth putting up with the food. Or at least I'd hope so. 

So if you are an out-of-towner looking for a Vegas cultural bizarro experience, then by all means, go here. But, if on the other hand, you wish to also eat nice food, skip it, and find an authentic food experience.",0.0965415432521,259,3.01,2009-02,23,6,4,2

My friend ordered a Mabo tofu dish and it was evident after everyone else had finished their meals, that it was NEVER coming. Our waiter was not to be seen, so we flagged another table's waiter asking if he could check on the status of our order. This waiter's attitude was horribly rude and condescending. And instead of going to check, he decided to state that Mabo tofu takes a long time. Really? It doesnt take long to prep and fry up some tofu, meat and sauce in a wok and pour the deal over rice. I've made this dish plenty of times, there really are no good excuses. Were they still growing the rice out in the paddies in the back? Soybeans still being picked? Were they picking their chopsticks from out of their asses? 

Finally, our waiter came by after a few centuries and by this time everyone else had finished their meals. So we said, ""We ordered a Mabo Tofu which we'd like to..."", And instead of allowing us to complete a sentence--he waved us off rudely while making a hostile face and impatiently hurried to the back. The missing dish decided to make an appearance after a few minutes(which suspiciously looked like it was freshly cooked after we inquired about it). Finally we were able to tell him we wanted to cancel our order because it was so very late. Then he proceeded to shoot us a NASTY look as if it were our fault for wasting their time and food. Really? The food was already 30 minutes late by that time. When the bill came, they still charged us for steamed rice and the gratuity was already included on the bill--which at this point added insult to injury. Again, we asked them to remove the sneaky rice from our bill. No apologies by their management or the waiters for slothful, inattentive service or hostile waiters.

This place is really a 1.5 stars for me, but I'm going to round up for these guys.  The hostess in the front desk was pretty cool, but not the rest of the staff.  Sadly that is about the only good thing I can say about this place.  Now on to the rest of the review.

I visited this place because I was in the mood for some pho and happen noticed this place while driving by.  Dropped in and the first thing was the massive waiting line to be seated.  There were lots of people waiting outside too.  Waiting outside on a HOT summer day is not fun.  After 30 minutes of waiting, we were finally called and seated.  This is where everything started to go down hill from here.

We were seated and we knew what we wanted because we were looking over the menu while we were waiting, so we ordered a coconut drink, the regular pho bowl and spring rolls.  The server wrote that down on his notepad and just disappeared.  We waited for at least 30 minutes and not one single item we ordered arrive on our table.  We then started to notice people that were seated after us got their order and they were chomping away.  After about 40 minutes of wait time I was wondering how long it takes to make just a simple coconut drink.  Are they sending a monkey to climb up a coconut tree to retrieve the coconut or something?

We finally saw our waiter and asked him to check on our order and he returned back to us to let us know they were out of spring rolls, therefore they did not make the pho or the coconut drink.  The thing was, the server said it in a way where it was OUR fault that we ordered something they ran out of and that's why they couldn't complete our order.  I just don't understand how when they ran out of one item that is no way related to the other items on the order could prevent the entire order to be made.  It's not like it was a combo or something.  I understand if I ordered a #1 at Mc Donalds and they tell me they ran out of fries, then I would order something else, not make me wait 30 minutes and tell me they are out of fries therefore they can't make the burger.  I really wanted to tell the server to GTFO here cause there is no way you run out of spring rolls in a Vietnamese pho restaurant.  It's the second most popular dish right after pho.  Its like a chinese restaurant running out of rice.  This is a MEGA CATASTROPHIC EPIC FAIL.  

The food finally arrived after putting in our order the second time, but the coconut drink did not.  I was about to take off my shoes and go out back to get the coconut down from the tree myself.  The pho dish was OK to average at best!  After waiting 45 minutes of waiting I have the right to have high expectations.  The size of the bowl was really small.  I wonder if they gave us the kids size bowl by mistake.  I can't believe they charge $8 for this kid size bowl of pho.  I can get a bowl of pho that is twice the size for $5-$6 at home!  The coconut drink finally arrived about halfway into finishing our food.  The drink was meh.  

In the end, the food was average, but the customer service just left a really bitter taste in my mind.  People think it is a good thing that they are open 24 hours.  No guys, that is not a good thing, they are there to FAIL 24 hrs a day.  Would you like to go to a place that fails 8-10 hrs a day or 24 hrs?

The broth isn't as flavorful as some other places I've tried in Los Angeles, but it was still decent. Best in Vegas.

Simply put, PKL is A-OK. Their pho satiates the appetite. Their broth is pretty good and the rest of the ingredients complement the soup nicely. Unfortunately, they do not serve tripe, which for me is a bummer. However, they do have that ""home made"" style chili sauce that I strangely prefer over plain old Sriracha. There's nothing wrong with Sriracha of course; I'm just weird like that.

One thing that PKL has going for it is the decor. Places like Pho So 1 make better pho but are completely devoid of any personality. You would never confuse PKL with a diner. That's really not that important to me though.

In the end, it's all about the pho. In that case, PKL is good enough, especially when no other place is open.",0.0290922619048,804,3.92,2008-10,35,1,0,0

My table only had a total of 3 orders (I shared with another and one of us wasn't hungry, but just wanted to hang out).

I walked up and complained that they should split up the order into two separate transactions. They gave me attitude since I was adamant about it.

- Some people at the table ate there before. They have always had pickled onions. This time when we asked for them, the waiters claimed that the restaurant never had them. Liars.

Since I first came to this place, the quality of the restaurant itself had changed dramatically.. only for the good though! Since the management changed a couple of times, the cleanliness of the environment had skyrocketed. There used to be an open area seafood, like the tanks you would see at 99 Ranch or any other Asian market, which was cool and all, but they got rid of it and added an extra table. The drinking water (thank god) was also one of the many things that they had switched around! Oh yea, I think they charge on soda refills, so beware!

Of course, for food, you would most likely end up ordering the Pho whether it would be the soup or rice noodles, for example, the common  Pho Dac Biet (combination noodles). Sadly, they're kind of mean with the meatballs :( I would only see one floating around. On the other hand, also try the charbroiled pork chop, that one is pretty bomb as well.

They're open late night so if you're out on the strip with your friends or are looking for a late night snack (hardly the size for a snack), Mr. Pho Kim Long is your best bet to satisfy your Vietnamese craving.

The service isn't super because of the lack of personality their staff has but they bring your food out fairly quick. Does one base service on how quick you get to eat or how pleasant they make your visit? I say it depends on both but lucky for Pho Kim Long, their service is very fast and consistent.  It wouldn't hurt the staff to crack a smile or two, crack a joke, or laugh even. They don't have a problem splitting your checks as long as they get their money.  The atmosphere is very traditionally Asian and being of Asian descent, it doesn't do much for me.  In other words, you wont catch me with my iPhone in hand snapping shots like some tourist or something. Maybe, the food for Yelp but that's all ;)

Never had a problem customer service-wise, always accommodated the big groups of friends I go everywhere with, and doesn't take log to bring what you ask for. That's a big thing for me when the server takes the detour to bring you something you've asked for.

I don't believe we had reservations for 30+ people, but they were quick to accommodate us when arriving.  It seemed there was a prefixed menu negotiated for our large party, and it consisted of the typical Vietnamese family-style menu items you would see standard in any restaurant worth their salt.

For a pho restaurant, this is probably one of the nicer looking ones I've seen... of course, this is targeted towards the touristy crowds, but still a breath of fresh air compared to all of the hole-in-the-walls I've been to.  I asked around about Vietnamese restaurants, and even the cab driver [local native Vietnamese] recommended this place, and it did not disappoint.  We had canh chua, ca kho, fried rice, fried shrimp, etc... and it was so nice to have home style food to end our weekend of debauchery and make us miss home even more.  [5 days in Vegas is overkill... 3 IS MORE than enough for me!]

The part that made me happiest?  The had fresh coconut juice there, and when you order it, they serve you nothing else but a coconut straight up.  I had oodles of fun scraping at the meaty flesh to round out my meal, and we all left stuffed.  If I remember right, we had at least 4-5 tables and I don't remember the cost, but I do know it was quite cheap because I heard no one complaining... haha.

I got the Pho Tai (pho with thin beef slices), and requested that the beef come on the side so that they weren't cooked well done in the broth by the time I got to them. The broth was really good (above average, I'd say). Ironically I put the slices in the broth a little too late, and my last few pieces wouldn't properly cook because the broth was no longer hot enough. I asked for a little more broth too cook those pieces, and they happily obliged (probably with a chuckle, knowing the amateur mistake I made). This pho tasted better usual; to be fair, it could've been because of the previous night that I had, but it was delicious.

I also recommend ordering a fresh young coconut to drink. They give you a coconut with the top cut off, and with a straw to drink and spoon to scrape off some of the meat. Quite tasty!

The staff at this place is excellent at serving the customers. I think everyone that was working at Pho Kim Long (I can't stop laughing at this name) came up to our table (except the cooks).

I ordered the Bun with Egg Rolls (cho gio) and char-grilled BBQ pork. The bowl was a bit smaller than usual but it was very well made. This is a simple dish but the key item is the noodles. Sometimes they are too soggy or they can also be too dry and sticky. This place had perfect noodles for the Bun. 

The servers gave us some Pho broth since it was so cold outside. Very nice gesture! Everyone had a small bowl of broth which was very good in flavor. However, if this is the Pho broth they use for every dish then I would avoid the Pho since it was a bit heavy in texture. I thought it should be more watered down. We had an additional order of fried egg rolls which was pretty decent, nothing fantastic but still good. 

Something unique about this place is their variety of Asian cuisine. They are obviously mainly Vietnamese but you can also find Chinese dishes and even Pad Thai. Very unusual in my experience.

I ended up eating like all of them, but she said the steak was tender and juicy and whatever makes red meat good (that's what she said), not into it but those accompaniments were the business! The Thai iced tea doesn't come with refills and that sucks because I can drink like 8 of those. right now. Let's go. Woman vs Drink.

It's complex though with spices like star anise in it. A little lemon lifts it up a bit to where I like it. It's a bit fatty so it's not for everyone, but the meat parts are pretty soft. 

The BF got singapore noodles. It was kinda meh...he said it was heavy on curry powder that you can't taste anything else. Definitely better elsewhere (like Food Express or Wendys Noodle Cafe).",0.14625,1060,3.81,2009-04,77,1,3,2
36.126177,-115.193971,3,3.5,"It's the wee hours post-partying in Vegas + we were hungry... I busted out my phone, opened the Yelp app + in no time Pho Kim Long popped onto my screen. About 300 reviews, 2.5 stars average, one $ sign, + the words ""late-night"" as one of the highlights... Good enough for me! 

No need to detail my visits to the curiously-named hot spot as all it comes down to is needing a place to fill the stomach + to sober up whether it's the wee hours or late morning. It's in a strip mall right along Spring Mountain Rd so parking is not a problem... just expect it to be a bit crowded during late hours. The selection on the menu is a decent variety of Vietnamese dishes, but the pho options are pretty limited. Regardless, somehow I find myself ordering a bowl of Pho Tai (rare beef) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA?select=_jQ4QD84l_CUpsLD8L9LSg or something similar every time. A bowl of pho is about $7-8, which is on the pricey side compared to what I'm used to both in Northern or Southern California, but the portion size is good enough. Quality is okay... soup is filled nearly to the brim, but the broth could be more flavorful + the noodles/beef are whatever. Average at best. We got spring rolls once, which were equally not noteworthy in any way other than that they actually gave us 2 peanut sauce dipping bowls... for the 3 of us. o_O http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA?select=n7M27mi6yD0uqDjCHP6VPw  Perhaps next time I'll try something other than pho since most of the more positive reviews here seem to be for other items on the menu. 

In retrospect, I'm sure there's better late night eats of the soupy-noodley sort in the Chinatown area or elsewhere off the Strip, but Pho Kim Long does its job. I'd give 2.5 stars if I could... but I'm rounding up. 3 stars for a convenience of this 24-hour, clean place to chow down because sometimes there's just nothing more satisfying than a steaming bowl of noodles.",0.162828111042,238,3.8,2009-01,78,3,4,5
36.126177,-115.193971,4,3.5,"Some of my brother's Vietnamese friends eat pho for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  There are lots of pho places around Vegas where he lives, So when he wants  this even at midnight, Pho Kim Long is his go to place. They also make some decent Chinese food. Some of the tables around us had your usual pan fried noodles, whole fried fish, and sweet and sour pork.  But most people had pho. 

Although more salty than I personally like, the simple broth and noodles has a light, nice aroma served in a large bowl.  Add meat, like rare steak slices, along with some condiments, like basil, bean sprouts, and onions ($7), it was an awesome meal in itself.  I was going to order the same thing, but for the same price, you can get a half rotisserie small chicken with rice.  It was crispy on the outside, and moist and tender on the inside ($7). So simple, yet so good.

Customers are mostly families during the day till early evening.  After that, they're the winners and mostly losers from the casinos, and sobering drunken clubbers and night shift workers. The inside is comofrtable and nicely appointed with ample booths or tables. During lunch dinner. no matter what day, it is crowded.  Finding a parking spot, however, is a war of patience and luck.  Fortunately, a guy was pulling out just as we walked inside, so we didn't have to exhibit our Type A parking lot Ninja tactics. While waiting to be seated, I enjoyed their relaxing goldfish tanks. 

This place is so typical Vegas with a Vietnamese and Chinese twist. I'd go back to try a few more dishes.  Service was good, prompt with the soda ($2) refills and special requests, and making sure all was OK.",0.193869047619,566,3.64,2008-12,50,3,3,3

Previous memories here were not so memorable, I always threw up here because I was so hungover from. A crazy night of partying.  Hana so this time im actually gonna sit down and take the time to eat. I ordered the roasted chicken with the rice. The only reason why I ordered it was because I was comparing it with the 1.99 place in westminster....and yeah. That wasn't even a challenge the dish was pretty bad. It was dry and bland. The nuoc nam didn't taste authentic, but the pho was alright not tooo shabby.

I tried some of the pho broth and it wasn't all that great either.  I don't think anyone in our group liked their food.  But when I came to Vegas another time, I stayed in the hotel room feeling sick while everyone else went to eat.  When they came back, my friend brought me the most delicious wonton noodle soup with duck meat.  When we ate here this time, my friend told me the duck wonton soup came from this restaurant.

Pho Kim Long is open 24 hours a day and will cure your craving for pho without paying the astronomical prices on the Las Vegas Strip.  Even if you get a large bowl with extra meat, you're still looking at less than 10 bucks.

While the service is quite fast, it's not the most personable but does that really matter after a night of clubbing and being slightly less than sober?

If you're not in the mood for soup, the tender beef with black pepper sauce and broccoli is really good.

I had to work the next day so I definitely needed my voice to stay with me. My husband knows that at times like this I need Pho so he said he would find something to eat on Pho Kim Long's menu. He said he would settle for a salad because he wasn't really hungry. 

Well just as a heads up to others that may be seeking salad ...there is none. He did find Beef and Broccoli which is kind of like salad. He ate almost all of it except the little bit I took to taste it. The amount that was given is easily a good amount for two to three people but he finished it even though he wasn't that hungry! The meat was well seasoned and the broccoli was nice and crispy. I hate soft broccoli! 

I ordered the chicken fried rice for lunch this week at work since I came in on late Sunday I had no time to cook. It was pretty basic the chicken pieces didn't have any fat on them which is a good thing. I spiced it up with some Sriracha. 

The Pho was good it wasn't too salty the veggies that came with it were fresh but I was surprised that they served it with lemon. When I usually get Pho I 've always been given limes to go with it. I wasn't going to be picky about it though. My Pho had the beef strips in it but it also came with these round meatballs . I didn't try it though ...I was wondering what it was . I concentrated on the broth just so my throat would feel better by morning. The Pho did help my throat on Monday but had to call in sick on Tuesday.",0.061044973545,559,3.99,2010-05,25,0,1,0
