All of their chicken is fresh, never frozen. Their stir fry's were my favourite menu items.\n\nThey have a great patio with televisions, high top tables, and if you can time it right you might also be able to snag a few of their comfortable lounge chairs.\n\nInside there are booths with individual televisions, a bar area with high top tables, a party room that accommodates sports teams and a big screen television with tables in front of it for all the big games, fights, etc.", "business_id": "vcwmvs5yM5Tf9vUy74zEhw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-07-28", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}, "user_id": "2T7knp7-VH6ZonMzTvVJ-w", "review_id": "56WpgvVhJaOfys2-UHm7RA", "text": "I've been to McGinnis front row at least 50 times in the last twenty years.

This is a sports bar, that also serves as a great place for friends and family to hang out, watch a game, and enjoy each others company.\n\nThere's a massive screen tv and another section where each booth has their own tv.  The sports theme has been their staple.  I appreciate the throwback Blue Jays art, and the fact that they support both WLU and UW evenly in the establishment.\n\nOne of the pluses about this place is that they aren't afraid to experiment with changing their menu.  I often try the new items and they have never disappointed.  They also have a number of staples.  My wife loves their nachos.\n\nThis trip I tried one of their poutine variants and stole some of my sons ravioli.  Though I liked the poutine the ravioli was awesome.\n\nThe other plus for the kids is the sundae cart.

(The first time I went, I went with 3 friends and we were all dressed in very casual clothing. It was a little awkward since we were having dinner, and there were candles and everyone around us was dressed up and on a date or with their families.

They also bring out some complimentary crispy rolls (?) and sauces for you to dip them in and they taste amazing!!\n\nThe best value is to go during lunch time. For lunch, they only have a buffet. The one time I went, they had fruit, butter chicken, naan, a type of goat curry, chicken tandoori, potatoes, some beans/veggies dishes, dessert and ice cream. Great value!\n\nMy only complaint is parking. Masala Bay is located next to a hotel, and there is a private lot but I guess the hotel claims all the parking spots there since there are signs everywhere that state parking is reserved for hotel guests only.

Our shrimp appetizer came with the nasty table sauce and cost $10 for four small fried shrimp. On the menu they allegedly have some special sauce, but it's just the little table sauces and nothing special.

He nearly threw the food on the table and interrupted our conversation. I mentioned it to the hostess; she said he usually works in the kitchen and has a condition that makes it difficult for him to work with customers.

I decided to go with my heart.\n\nWhile it came close, I just couldn't bring myself to give it perfect marks because the fact is, I came out of there under-impressed. \n\nFirst of all, I don't think it was super authentic. A lot of the descriptions left me quite confused. Was I in a french restaurant? Was I at a sports bar? What the heck should I get to give me a \"true Indonesian experience\"?! So maybe it was a fusion, which is cool too since when it comes to food, I am 100% open-minded. Either way, I don't usually judge food by its 'authenticity' (I have one criteria, yummy or super yummy), so this is not even where it lost its mark.\n\nI ordered the Laksa and it was beautifully presented, little bamboo steamer for the rice and all. The seafood swam on a delightful broth that was sweet and flavorful. It became sort of a saving point once I tried the rice, because that was aromatic but somewhat blend for my taste. The bone that I had to pick was, none of the seafood stood out in particular for me, not the mussel, nor the shrimp, and even the scallop that I was momentarily impressed with, I later remembered it tasted exactly like the fried scallops that I get at my relative's fish and chips place. They were not overwhelmingly creative or flavorful, maybe it was the way they were cooked or the sauce that complemented them, I don't think they brought out that burst of freshness that should come with seafood. Essentially, while the meal was NICE, it was well... nothing special.\n\nAnd why do I insist on having something special? If I'm going to be paying $50 something for a meal while on a student budget... is that too much to ask?\n\nMaybe I am overly critical, and if someone treats me to this again, I would gladly follow along and have a great meal, but in terms of my expectation and the reality, all I can say is that maybe it was built up too much.

Her deer was over cooked and tough, the potatoes were under cooked.  Neither of us could cut through the over fried pastry wrapping some vegetables.\n\nIt was a special occasion, so we ordered a vintage bottle of wine.  Upon tasting the wine, I had expressed some concerns and we agreed to re evaluate in 15 minutes.  After 15 minutes I had to ask for the manager repeatedly, she eventually arrived after another 15 minutes went by.  She took the position that the wine is fine just not to our liking and offered 2 complementary glasses of house red wine.  I disagreed, this $200 bottle of wine is either spoiled or terrible, in any case not drinkable after being stored in their cellar for many years.\n\nSo we had no wine to drink until half way through our main entree.  I burnt my mouth on the tempura frog legs.  It took 10+ minutes for them clear the appetizer plates.  They also insisted on serving a dessert tray even though I advised them I cannot eat sugar and desserts.\n\nThis restaurant missed the point by squabbling over an expensive bottle of wine.  They should have focused on making this a great dining experience; instead it was one of the biggest dining disappointments we've experienced, costing $367 for 2 (without tip).\n\nFor the record, we consumed no more than 3 oz of the wine that we paid for but they have.  I even left them with my phone number in case the owner wanted to make amends (as the manager seemed to have no authority).  I suggested that I pay for the 2 glasses of wine and I will return again, or I will reluctantly pay for the (undrinkable) bottle of wine and never return.  They chose the latter and lost a customer.\n\nP.S.  I would have rated it one star but I give some credit to the manager trying to appease us (as ineffective as that was).\n\nP.P.S.

The prices are pretty steep averaging around $35 per entree. They have a reason to price it at that level though.\n\nWe ordered the dry aged angus rib eye beef with red curry, and the surf and turf, which included beef tenderloin slivers and giant tiger shrimps. Both portions were very generous. The surf and turf was very flavourful, but it just couldn't compare to how great the rib eye was. I had ordered it medium rare and they had cooked it perfectly. They finished it off with an incredibly crispy exterior and an unbelievably juicy pink interior. Forget the red curry sauce, I was perfectly content with devouring the steak as it was. The onion rings were lightly battered and deep fried to add more crunch to the overall plate.\n\nThe service was very amicable and attentive. My favourite moment was when I had asked for my steak to be packed up to-go, and they had packaged the take-out in the form of an aluminum swan. Very cute and added a nice element of surprise.\n\nThe restaurant has an exotic ambiance to it and the lighting is pretty dim. It isn't too noisy inside so it makes it a nice place to bring a date and have an intimate conversation.

All that being said it was the best decision I ever made in my life. Not only did I get to study something I loved at a place where the professors actually cared and engaged with me during my course of study but it transformed me as a human being socially. WLU lives up to its reputation of being one of the most spirited and involved student body out of any other university in Ontario. I was able to find my social and athletic niches here while exploring other new ones that helped me broaden my horizons. The campus is small, and although growing rapidly, still manages to maintain a small town feel where if you really want to can know almost everyone. As a local that lived at home in Kitchener for 2.5 years of my degree rushing the Sigma Chi Fraternity at WLU was the greatest decision I ever made in my life. Not only was this the catalyst for engaging myself on campus and in what the university had to offer but the most valuable skills, experiences and connections I gained while in university came from being a member of that organization. Additionally I took the opportunity to spend a semester abroad in Australia at the Australian Catholic University thanks to great study abroad programs offered by WLU. I wouldn't trade my experience here for anything in the world, great education and great life experience that made me a better person.\n\nWLU sure lives up to its motto, \"Inspiring lives of leadership and purpose.\"", "business_id": "ONrbGB7QorD3TCZWtb4WLg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-06-18", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "qrkAaSL1C_cT7Z6nUi_bxQ", "review_id": "YvbvtuVg3HcW3uz29vWVUA", "text": "The campus is small and compact, thus as far as universities go it is easy enough to find your way around.

When his pasta arrived he tried to eat it but I couldn't even bare to eat mine because the smell was so terrible.

He was very friendly and informed us he would go get his manager and when they returned to the table she began grilling us. We are in our early 20's and I'm not sure if that's what encouraged her to address us in such an inappropriate manner but she did, she accused us of being unfamilier with seafood and the smell that it omits. When we told her we ate seafood regularly she implied that was a lie. They offered to replace the exact dish but it was obvious that the crab meat was canned, rubbery and likely old so he opted to try some basic chicken wings instead.

We purchased a room at a 3-star hotel on Hotwire and it turned out to be at the Radisson.  \n\nOur room was very clean and nice but when I went to use the bath tub, the stopper (which was built in to the tub) would not close the drain.  I called the front desk to complain and at first they said that there was nothing that they could do since it was just the front desk staff working overnight and they didn't know how to do repairs on the bathtub drain.  I told them that that wasn't really okay with me since this was a special occasion for my partner and I.  They put me on hold for a brief minute and came back to tell me that they could switch our room for us and that they would even deliver our keys to us and escort us to the new room.\n\nA few minutes later, the attendant was at our door with new room keys and a voucher for 2 free room service delivered breakfasts! We were very pleased with that but even more pleased to discover our new room was a total upgrade!  We were put in to a suite with a nice bedroom with a flat-screen TV on the wall, a big bathroom (in which the drain worked!), a living room area and tons of other lovely extra features!  \n\nThe breakfast was delicious, the staff were friendly and courteous and although the style of the rooms was slightly out-dated, (very 70s looking) we were very impressed by the level of cleanliness of the rooms, hallways, and front reception area.  Unfortunately, we didn't get a chance to check out the pool area.\n\nBe careful, you WILL be charged for local calls which surprised me but it wasn't really a big deal at all.\n\nOverall, this was an excellent stay and I would recommend the Radisson to anyone visiting Kitchener or Waterloo.  I really got the sense that the people that work here care about their customers and they truly did everything they could to make our stay a comfortable and welcome one.

I ordered the Grilled Lobster, shrimp skewer, and scallops dish for 28.99.  What a disaster.  The baked potato (side dish) was crusted in salt, and to me the best part is the skin - so that ended that. - The Atlantic lobster tail was literally dripping an orange oil, tasted strange (?) and was chewy and miserably overcooked, never mind being really small.  The shrimp skewer was flattened, swimming in salty oil and overcooked or twice cooked?  The scallops - oh my - I have never had such atrocious scallops in my life.  Small - Tough, chewy with a leathery outer skin.  Simply disgusting and I spat them out.  You could have bounced them off the walls they were so rubbery.  The appetizer I had chosen was the Seafood stuffed mushrooms.  I expected alot more flavour than I got.  Also, the clam chowder which for years was a favourite of mine, was thin and had almost nothing in it apart from cubed potato.  My dinner partner however did well.  She ordered the escargot to start - small but delicious, and the crab linguini alfredo - a huge dish and also very delicious. - Be prepared to take it home for three more lunches though!  Since this is the third time I have been served overcooked dreadful lobster here this is the last time.  Having checked the nutrition data oline however, I was not prepared to go on dialysis come Monday for salt poisoning from getting the delicious and rich Linguini. Unfortunately many of our favourite restaurants were getting ready to close so the choice was limited to this or a fast food place and we were hungry. As it was, I thought I ordered carefully, and ate carefully and still managed to consume twice the daily recommended dose of sodium.

It congeals all the queasy, uneasy-ness remaining from the night before, gives you purpose for the day ahead and at the very least makes you warm and sleepy so you can enjoy your day ahead in bed. \n\nStudents, local business folks and Waterloo locals have been coming to Angie's diner for this exact purpose for over 50 years, and this sunday my WLU Alumni friends and I staggered into Angies as we had so many times during our undergrads excited for what was ahead - a CORNUCOPIA of breakfast options, fresh baked breads and pastries and home made jams - ughh gives me hangover-boner just thinking about it (Sorry for the inappropriate reference but when you're talking #FoodPorn Angie's is tops when it comes to a breakfast/brunch 3some).\n\nBefore getting to my near sexual breakfast experience I will point out that this was NOT the same Angie's we had frequented so many times in our youth. Yes the breads were baked the same and the Jams were made with the same love BUT this Waterloo mainstay had received a makeover something amazing on the inside and the food somehow tasted way better for it!! No more wood paneling and awful seat coverings. A beautiful matte black finish paint covers the walls now, the white trim seems crisper and the booths and seats have been re-upholstered with a beautiful black leather fabric. Even more there is new hardwood flooring....basically the once tacky interior we loved was now something super chic looking that the older version of me found even more endearing. LOVED IT!!! Nice work team.\n\nOk so now back to the foodporn. I'll keep my points short as I feat that discussing it too long will cause me to prematurely \"salivate\". We were in a big group (8 hungover hungry dudes) and we ordered a variety of options but here is what my order consisted of:\n\n- Saw someone at the table next to me ordering a fresh HOT steaming Sinnamon Bun (no spelling error), and I literally had to hold back from letting a small cry from escaping my lips - I ordered one - IMMEDIATELY! WOW....so long cinna-bon, hello Angies!!! Light, fluffy, melt in your mouth cinnamon and dough. Not overly sweet and HUGE! Admittedly I moaned a bit loud on my first bite (apologies to the table next to us who looked over). \n\n- For my main I opted for the eggs Benedict (a personal fav). I knew something was different with the menu here from the last time I was in once I tried my Benny with Peamale. The hollandaise sauce sauce was oustanding - far and away the greatest I've had (and I've had it everywhere). Not overly buttery and a perfect consistency. Like wow....oops I just salivated all over myself....I'm embarrassed...No I'm not!\n\nSuch a great experience - even had a chance to speak with the current owner of Angie's Diner about her renovation adventures (they did it all in a weekend!) and I thought her coming over to check on us personally was a really nice touch!!\n\nX-FACTOR - they make their own breads and jams (which they use in all their breakfasts) BUT you can also purchase loaves of your fav bread or jars of ur fav Angies preserves when your cashing out.

I only ever went to this place for their sandwiches, which they have become famous for in the KW area. Whenever asked about my favourite sandwich I would always refer to the variety of toppings that I could select from at this place. \n\nI was first introduced to artichoke caponata at Vincenzo's as a sandwich topping, and very quickly the artichoke caponata spread that they make so well has become a favourite spread not only for sandwiches but also for crackers or on top of slices of baguette. There is no other art-cap, as many refer to it, like Vincenzo's. For me, they also made pesto-mayo a sandwich \"must-have\". What a simple topping, but also what a flavourful combination. I've tried to replicate at home, but I just haven't gotten the proper consistency. To add a kick of spice to their sandwiches they also offer the Bomb. The bomb is a nice and spicy taponade that they serve as a sandwich spread. While I am not also up for the spice, when I am, this sure does the trick. Be careful though, its really spicy! \n\nWhen it comes to actual toppings, they have your typical sandwich toppings like lettuce, tomato, cucumber, green pepper, black olives, onions, pickles, hot peppers, and bruschetta, but to set themselves apart from many other sandwich places around town they offer fancier toppings (at an additional cost of 25 cents) which include but are not limited to, artichokes, sundried tomatoes, and roasted eggplant. When it comes to meats and cheeses, if you want it, they've got it. They provide a list of meats and cheeses to choose from, but they also have an expansive selections of meats and cheeses not on their board, that if you see at the deli counter you can request on your sandwich. While their sandwiches have gone up in price, they still sit around the $5 mark and are well worth the money!\n\nThis place does not only offer sandwiches though. They have a hot food counter, a salad bar, a desserts and pastries counter, as well as a sushi bar. The sushi is made in house and is not bad. \n\nThis place is also a grocery store, which offers a wide variety of products that you will not find at your local supermarket. While the prices on some of grocery items are more than a local supermarket would offer, the quality you are receiving is reflected in the price. They have some fantastic fresh pasta which comes frozen and you order by the gram. They also have some fantastic breads to choose from in their bakery section. On your way out, if you are leaving through the back (where there is seating to eat your food) they also have a gelato counter and little cafe. They make great coffee here. \n\nThere is nothing bad I can say about this place. Whenever I am in Waterloo I make it a must to stop here and either grab a quick sandwich or some other food selection. Beware, I am not the only one who likes this place, and it has become quite the hot spot in Waterloo, so make sure you give yourself some time when you go!", "business_id": "ej_Ovd4GuqnFv6d4i54Z7Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-08-01", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "2kRBryOXL2RX33UH5xWZmQ", "review_id": "LfSQUaaC-FGCu5AWm7eMzA", "text": "Excellent selection of European and local products.

It's a good mix and performs well all around. I'm simply going to review a few of the services since there are many. I've had plenty of sandwiches and have had coffee there  about twice. If you're into coffee, they made a solid cappuccino but I would have a few more to really give a fair impression.\n\nGrocery store/bakery:\n\nNow when I say grocery store, this is not your typical supermarket. It's got tons of options, many fresh and many imported from Europe. If you're looking for a specific cheese, they'll probably have it. They even have Queso Fresco, which is a rarity (try it on Pizza). You need olives, there's an abundance of selection including fresh olives (low sodium), which is also rare. Same goes for bread, meat, fish, clams, shrimp (keeping in mind, we are inland),  spices, bottled/canned goods from Europe, and plenty of other things that I've omitted. The only section that doesn't have a ton of options is the fruits and vegetables but if you're really picky about this kind of thing best to go to a market. Also, before I forget, the fresh pasta and raviolis are excellent. Well worth getting fresh the stuff over the dry options IMO.\n\nThe store is incredibly well staffed. It's actually impressive how much staff works there. Also, the staff is quite knowledgeable and most seem to be foodies. If you have any questions, they can usually answer them with specific recommendations.  Unless you're waiting for a sandwich or pasta at a peak time (lunch), the service is very quick.\n\nNow the only negative I have of Vincenzo's grocery shopping is because it's got such an awesome selection of delicious food, you might overspend a bit but at least you know you're getting quality and service. \n\nSandwich counter: \n\nthis is almost  a separate business from the grocery store since many people do come in just for lunch. It is very good. There is a great selection (just like the store) for everything you'd like to put in the sandwich starting with the bread and ending with toppings (Artichoke Caponata, Sun Dried Tomato Caponata, Bruschetta among others) . I find that you end up making your sandwich differently because of the choices, which makes it much less repetitive than going to subway. Also, the sandwiches are very well priced. I would highly recommend going here instead of Subway or other chains.\n\nPasta Counter (Thursdays only):\n\nI haven't personally experienced the pasta but my friend really enjoyed the dish that was made for him. There is a selection of meat, shrimp or chicken, then sauces and vegetables, with some delicious sauces (pesto, tomato, cream-based, etc). This is cooked on a stove in front of you. Like the sandwiches, the pasta dishes are well priced. The only negative is that the line can be long for this counter, which will take a while so try to go with a friend to keep you company.\n\nHot counter:\n\nThere is also a hot counter, which I have yet to sample but it also looks quite good.

Okay, It was my first time here and I was just excited about all the different sauces, cheese, fish, desert etc...\n\nAs soon as you walk Into the store it smells like smoked meat; Damn delicious smoked meat! Its a little confusing at first, because in front you are tall shelves full of bread dips and more soy sauces then I cared to count.  Behind is a rack of biscottis and wafers.

It's quite rare to find a place that has high quality unique items from Europe in GTA suburbia ... let alone from the KW area!  This place feels like the UN consortium for food.  It has a bit of everything.  It has a deli, butcher, cheesemonger (is that even a word? if so, what a great word), savoury and sweet sauces and condiments, seafood, hot plate area, cafe, gelato (!!), groceries, and baked goods. I've been here for lunch a few times and I will say that their foods is not as good as the actual store area but it's still a delightful place for Waterloo.\n\nI first came here for lunch and didn't expect a great little retail store as well.  I ordered a sandwich at first and to be fair, the menu sounded a lot better than the execution.  I had the smoked chicken sandwich on a calabrese bun with their 'famous' artichoke caponata and various veggies.  I think for the price, it is fair but it just wasn't as flavourful as it was described to me by the person behind the counter.  I was salivating at the idea of the artichoke caponata as she explained it to me as a beautiful savoury creamy blend of roasted nutty vegetable flavour.  To me, the spread was just a lightly flavoured mayo.\n\nI also headed to baked good areas and grabbed my favourite baked treat... MACARONS!  These were very reasonably priced for minis.  It was less than $1 a piece.  I was thrilled... until I ate it.  The texture of these were far from meringue like and they were heavy like a brick butter cookie.  Upon discovering this, I asked if they were baked recently and found these were frozen in Europe and imported over and defrosted months later here... ugh. Save yourself the trouble and do not buy these!  I also got a tiramisu here and for $5 it was a bit pricey.  I would hope an Italian place would do tiramisu well but this was a disappoint as well.  It tasted only of sugary whip cream and not even marscapone cheese and espresso.  \n\nThe cheese area brought back me to delighted stage.  I found so many great cheeses including real imported GOP buffalo mozzarella.  With the price at $6, I found it very reasonable for authentic GOP.  I also bought some GOP aged balsamic vinegar and it was phenomenal.  For $10, I got a lovely syrupy sweet and acidic black liquid gold that is perfect for grilled chicken.\n\nService is personable, quick, and friendly!

While the portions are generous, I have noticed that they have reduced them marginally over the decade or so we've been eating here.  I tend to eat here almost once a week.  \n\nI'm not a fan of their pad thai - while large in quantity, the flavor and seemed light on anything but noodle.  Their vietnamese dishes on the other hand, offer extraordinary value with pretty good flavor.  It's pretty easy to order with somewhat blurry pictures on their menus associated with descriptions, and anyone who has come here a few times pretty much knows their favorite dish by number.  The most popular vietnamese dishes are broken down into components and combined at your leisure on a platter (that include such things as pickled veggies, spring rolls, meat balls, thin rice noodles), or just some combination of meat and noodles in a soup (also quite filling).  \n\nYou might want to check out some of their funky drinks (I'm not too much of a fan myself but a lot of friends are).  My sister is a fan of their condensed milk + coffee though I'm not a coffee drinker myself.  \n\nPersonally, my standard is Fish Congee (which is an acquired taste, small or large #702) which I balance off with a side of fried spring rolls so as not to be too healthy.  Whereas chinese spring rolls have a flaky/wafer type wrap, these ones here seem like more of a batter and thicker shell - but I'm a fan of them (they also come included in a number of the vietnamese platters).  \n\nMost recently (yesterday) the bill for the six of us was about $60-70 including tip and we came away full but also with a doggy bag.  Their dinner and lunch menus are the same so you can typically expect to pay about the same - about $10/person including tip. \n\nOh and peanuts are everywhere so if you have a peanut allergy, definitely stay away.  \n\nThe service ranges between mediocre and good.  It can be tough to flag down someone to help you and they don't really time dishes so that they come out together.  They bring them out as they are more or less ready.  There are some dishes like Congee that take way longer than everything else probably because of volume so if you happen to know before hand, you can tell the waitress to put the order in first while everyone figures out their orders and you might get it at the same time as everyone else.   \n\nThis restaurant gets busy though.  While they don't take reservations, you can call them to put yourself on the wait list during dinner or lunch.  If you're trying to avoid the rush, you should try to get there at or before 5 pm would probably be best.

The pho tastes better on some days than others, but overall it's pretty good. The random thing is sometimes they run out of bean sprouts, or lime, or basil leaves. The pad thai is alright, and honestly, there are other places in Waterloo that make much tastier Pad Thai (i.e. My Thai). My favourite appetizer is the grilled pork meat balls. They are extremely tasty especially paired with the sweet peanut sauce. You also can't go wrong with the crispy spring rolls!\n\nBen Thanh also makes some of the best fruit shakes. My favourite flavours are pineapple and mango, though I've heard that avocado and durian are also quite good (I personally would never want to drink a liquefied version of either fruits).\n\nIn terms of value, it is average. You can definitely get cheaper food elsewhere, but Ben Thanh has a good environment (large sit down restaurant with nice decor and somewhat attentive waitresses) which is probably why it attracts so many people. Pho runs between $6.75 for a small to $8.95(?) for an XLarge.

We marked down an XL house special pho in our little sheet, and very soon the waitress came back to check on us. She looked at our order and confirmed with us that we were sharing. Soon she came back with 2 bowls and a ladle.\n\nAs we sat there waiting for our food to come, we noticed all the yummy looking food the other tables were eating.It made us feel even more hungry. \n\nWhen our pho arrived, we noticed that the beef actually came rare. This...well, never happened before. So it was another pleasant surprise for us. The pho was really good, and we weren't extremely thirsty afterwards, so that's always a good sign. The soup tasted great, the noodles were tender (not mushy or hard), and there was a variety of beef. :D In addition, the sweet sauce was not watered down, and they provided a chilli pepper on top of the bean sprouts, basil leaves, and lime. \n\nI would say this is the best pho restaurant I have ever been to. It looks good, it has great service, and the food is delicious. It is on the pricier side though, but we shared a XL bowl of pho and we were both full from it.

Not to be confused with the Optical department.\nI will preface by saying that the Optical department is actually quite awesome!  They are fast and friendly, and quite knowledgeable.  No issues there!\nHOWEVER\nI made an appointment with the Optometrist department to have a check-up.  I happened to arrive really early, so I poked my head in to see if there was a possibility that they could take me sooner than my appointment, in hopes of saving their and my time.  Unfortunately I was huffed at by the oh-so-pleasant receptionist (I will discuss her in a moment), and told to come back at my scheduled time.  Fine, no problem to me, I'll just do some walking around inside Costco to kill time.\nSo I return to the Optometrist office - on time, mind you - and have the pre-test completed by the receptionist.  I'm not sure why they let her do it since she can't, or doesn't know how to do it right because she told me she'd have to get the Optometrist to do it for her.  Now the good part.  I'm inside the room getting my check-up, and the Optometrist puts some drops in my eyes at the end, and instructs me to wait five minutes in the waiting room and she'll bring me back in to finish up.  She brings me back in after five minutes, finishes up, and I'm good to go.  I get two steps outside the door when my husband, whom was accompanying me, told me that while I was being examined by the Optometrist, the receptionist was LISTENING TO OUR CONVERSATION WITH HER EAR PRESSED TO THE DOOR.  My husband was extremely uncomfortable with that, and he suggested to her to not listen to our conversation, and she blatantly replied, \"I am privileged to listen to their conversation\".

Oh right, I'm in Software Engineering, cool program. Co-op jobs are generally pretty awesome.

University of Waterloo was a life changer for me. Here is why.\n\nThe Good:\n\nUniversity of Waterloo is not just another university that stands in middle of a city. It offers several top programs in Canada, including Engineering and Computer Science.\n\nOn top of that, you will be surrounded by very smart students and professors. I believe the environment that one is in is very important. In high school I was a kid who doesn't like to study, who doesn't like to think. After 5 years, the environment had made me into a kid who likes to think and who likes to learn new things. Without being surrounded by smart people, perhaps I am still that same kid from high school now.\n\nThe professors are amazing, most of the professors are always there for you, wanting you to succeed. \n\nCo-op program was a life changing experience for me. University's number of partnerships with employers in North America is huge. Co-op programs will let you learn life-time skills in job hunting.\n\nIf you are a person who wants to become smarter, just go to University of Waterloo. With smart people surrounding in you, you will become smarter.\n\nThe Bad:\nOne bad thing though is that their facility for engineering is old. Lab computers in for my program was slow.

I have been to the Moose a million times and liked it before, but they had a renovation there and I am not sure what the deal is...\n\nWe went to the Moose for a Surprise Birthday party for our buddy David who lives in KW. The reservation was for 7:00PM. We drove from Toronto and arrived, and the three super young hostesses were wearing headsets and all standing and talking behind the little hostess counter. We arrived at 6:45PM, and I approached the ladies, mentioned we are here for the Martinell reservation, David's Birthday. All Three of them same time snappily answered  \"your table isn't ready yet\"  I said is it okay if we go have a drink in the bar, they told me that was fine. They used to be really friendly when you arrived early, and if your table wasn't ready they would offer you a seat and drinks in the bar, I liked that.  The young ladies realized right away they were snappy so they all over-smiled at me and pointed over to the bar... At the bar who did we find... 6 more of the 10 people party (now were just missing the birthday boy and his brother)\n\ntime passes, 3 drinks later it is 7:25, Mark the brother is now stalling somewhere, were texting him, and these girls are hanging around at the front, seating other people, and pretty much having the best time ever! So I reproached and said our reservation was for 7:00, its nearly 7:30, when will we be seated... the answer... \"Your table isn't ready yet\"  David and Mark Arrive, NO SURPRISE... Surprise destroyed. We wait in the bar some more...\n\nwe explain what the plan was to David but that the table wasn't ready. Kind of a ruin-er to the birthday surprise, we get seated at nearly 8:00PM. \n\nEveryone was starving by now and pretty drunk and everyone had too many peanuts. (they have complimentary peanuts in the bar which is cool. )\n\nWe all order drinks, they came correctly and fast, ultra fast. The Server was this funny guy, shaved head, really cool. We also had another server helping (big table) and she was lovely! \n\nthe Birthday Boys Brother ordered a Burger with Cheese, Taite and I for lack of Vegan Options ordered Fish and Chips... and everyone else ordered whatever. \n\nIt's a bar in KW I don't expect them to have a Vegan Option. We always make due, this place was always great before.\n\nWe all pretty much got our food at the same time, the whole table except Mark and I... (Birthday Boy's Brother) Mark and I were sitting beside each other so we at least could chat while everyone else ate. 6 or 7 minutes passed and I hailed our waiter politely and asked about our food. He said he will check right now. He returns and said \"your fish is on the way out, they had to take some out\" and as for Mark this is what they told him \"Your Burger fell on the floor on the way out here, so they are pushing one out  for you now,\" We waited maybe 4-5 minutes and my fish and Mark's Burger came out at the same time.  My fish was steaming weird, and Mark picked up his burger and it all fell out of the bun, broken up and really over peppered as if they picked it up off the floor and returned it to the bun after a fast re-spice and re-grill. \n\nI asked the lovely ladies working the front door if they could get a manager to come speak to me. Mark was MORTIFIED about the floor burger !!! I cut into my fish at that moment and realized it was weird steaming because it was frozen in the middle... \nSICK! \n\nAnyway, Mark, a Manager himself explained that he didn't want this floor burger, which the moose manager agreed was unacceptable but told Mark there was no way it was the floor burger... It was totally the floor burger it was like mince meat pieces all over his bun... the thing looked dirty, and who serves a burger broken into 7 or 8  pieces. \n\nI mentioned my fish, which was already very late was very frozen to our server, not the manager, and he took it away.  I was still charged, the fish never returned. Though the food was very late and not eaten. \n\nMark made out better, he's more authoritative and  managerial than I am, he got a gift card, his burger was not charged but he was made to pay for his drinks, and his side gravy (strange) he also paid for David the birthday boys' meal. \n\nThey gave David a pie in the face which was fun, but besides our friendly server and the pie in the face this was a crapshoot visit to a usually decent place. I was EXTREMELY bothered that this visit wasn't handled with some more courtesy and care. It was nice they gave Mark a gift card, he definitely deserved it after the floor burger and late seating but Taite and I left there, went to Mark's house and ate mounds of chips to fill the gap. We played pool and rocked out so the birthday ended up still being fun! \n\nSad Night. I used to love you so much Moose Winooski's... I hope your renovation didn't turn you into something different, I liked your old gig.

I've heard of this place since my days in university 4-5 years ago.\n\nI arrived here with colleagues after a rather long day in the office. I was given a recommendation to try the pig tail - and got very intrigued at the idea.\n\nMy order consisted of:\n- An order of Braised Pigtails: Braised and grilled with Charcoal barbecue sauce or sweet brown sugar sauce, apple marmalade.\n- A 12oz portion of the Slow Roasted Prime Rib with a side of garlic mashed potatoes\n\nI was honestly surprised when the pigtails came out. I had some naive childhood imagination that a pigtail would be small, round and curly. Instead what came out resembled more of a 'rib' in appearance/size but upon closer inspection, you realize that it is a series of connected bones.\n\nThe flavour was delicious - I really enjoyed the barbecue sauce on them. In terms of texture, I would say it had a lot of cartilage - and that the meat came off the bone rather easily. I would compare it to the texture of chicken feet found in Chinese cuisine.\n\nRemember - use your hands when eating these. Forego the knife and fork. I managed to splatter sauce on my dress shirt and suit - trying to play it safe/clean.\n\n\nThe 12oz prime rib was very nice and tender. I ordered the dish medium-rare, and it definitely came out exactly as so. The horseradish was intense and packed quite a bit of flavour to it. I really like prime rib and would come back again for it.\n\n\nAll in all, we all had a very enjoyable meal. I wouldn't hesitate coming back again and trying some of their other steaks, or their ribs. \n\n\nCheck it out!", "business_id": "IcXqLqEdepAt_RuxKZnKvg", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-11-28", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "s-3rUTBQhwZqE-JsR5yG4Q", "review_id": "eB7yvGzEDKRviUE40OzZUA", "text": "I've stayed at the Radisson on two occasions for business and eaten here at least 3 times.

The cheese and crostini were awesome, however the broth is very sweet for a french onion soup.  I can't really recommend it.  For my entree I enjoyed the blackened trout.  It was seasoned very well and not overly spicy, which is sometimes a problem with blackened items.  The quinoa was pretty good with it and offset the blackened seasoning well.  The two wines I had were okay but for restaurant going for top-class I expected more body amongst the list.\n\nThe other times I've been here for steak have been great.

The first two times, I got a steak and it was so good. I never ever regret coming here, especially when I have that first bite. The prime rib is great too, I'm just not sure it's my thing. \n\nThey used to have a normal baked potato as a side, but for some reason they got rid of that. They offer a twice-baked potato now, which is good too but I don't like it as much. I miss my beloved normal baked potato :( The side veggies are also interesting, I like how they feature something a little different each time, like kale and beets. Yum. Mashed potatoes are a decent choice as well. Another note: there were these really awesome tiny dinner buns that came at the beginning of our meal and they got replaced by these flaky cheese pastry things. They are good, don't get me wrong, but it's like eating tasty air.\n\nLet them know if it's your birthday and they'll include a mint-chocolate chip dessert on the house. The creme brulee is relatively generous with its portion, a little on the eggy side. The flourless chocolate cake could be denser, but that's just because I love me some chocolate. For Valentine's day, they gave us little two macarons instead of mints with the bill. They were not very good macarons, but I really appreciate the gesture!\n\nAgain, the service is great.

Lunch buffet.\n\nLunch Buffet is $7.99 (as of Feb 12, 2014) and they used to advertise this price with a large banner outside the store (maybe taken down for winter?).\n\nI never ever ever write reviews about chain restaurants. In general, I find chains to be very bland and too similar from place to place (and it doesn't make for an interesting review). However, I've always wanted to try this lunch buffet since I used to see the banner up everyday in Waterloo.\n\nPIzzas are brought out as they are needed, there are vegetarian, pepperoni, meat + mushroom and other interesting assorted pizzas. There are also sweet cinnamon things that I think are most similar to Cinnabon, as well as a dessert apple pie/cinnamon on a pizza crust base. Oddly, I didn't see a cheese pizza. The salad bar is minimal, and has not-fresh lettuce, as well as croutons and 5 salad dressings (they seemed to have a difficult time keeping the salad bar stocked with lettuce?). There is pasta baked with cheese and a cold pasta salad.\n\nIf you want dipping sauce, I recommend putting a bit of salad dressing on your plate and dipping your pizza and/or crust as necessary. There is a slow cooker with tomato sauce, not sure if it's for the pizza, for the crust (there are small plastic sample cups beside it) or for the pasta.\n\nIt feels like this Pizza Hut is under-staffed, there seems to be only one guy who takes care of all the tables and seats people, which obviously leads to delays in clearing plates, filling drinks and seating people.\n\nLots of parking behind the building. But making a left turn out of the parking lot onto University may be difficult since Weber/University is a busy intersection.\n\nMy curiosity is satisfied now....

I used to like this place before they changed owners (or renovated), but not anymore. \n\nReasons  for 0 stars\n1. Subpar food, compared to its competitors mentioned above. Some friends had diarrhea, but I didn't. Food that could've been saltier was watery. Dishes that could have used less salt was salty enough for me not want to bring home the leftovers.\n\nBubble tea served here is beyond watery - the drink itself and tapioca aren't sweetened. Minimal ice cubes added. Not sure if it was water or crafted drink.\n\n2. Sketchy interior. I can see the vegetables and frozen meat and tofu boxes in the fridge, facing me. It's great to know that they're using unfrozen ingredients and stuff, but this really undermines the whole purpose of their renovation. Exposing things like that really worsens the restaurant atmosphere to a warehouse environment. \n\n3. Atrocious service quality. I know this is expected from a Chinese restaurant run by Chinese owners, but seriously, the shitty service is real. This is shown by one experience where I had brought food from another restaurant. Yes, indeed, it was my fault, but I sure as hell did not deserve to be told to \"get out.\" The tone in the server's voice was devoid of politeness. No words like \"sorry,\" \"please,\" or \"thank you,\" just \"this is store policy.\" Even though this incident was my wrongdoing, a customer should not be treated like this.\n\nFor the reasons above, you're better off spending your money elsewhere.", "business_id": "WKiZiAwKrF81YcfAjnOSjA", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-06-17", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "zuMIt-ZrQ0EFhesbLCkyvw", "review_id": "iuQGn92Mt8O_Ne3ZBWa3lA", "text": "I like this place!

Not an issue for us, but just something to be aware of depending on whether you like a big standalone shower (which that room did have) or a bathtub (which it did not)\n\nNegatives:\n- The first room we were assigned was clearly not ready when took our bags up; the door was propped open and the bed was not yet made. Front desk did quickly apologize and reassign a room, but not a great start to the stay\n- Hallway noise is noticeable from within the room; noise from housekeeping in the hallways in the morning woke up my wife \n- These are minor, but the fireplace is on a timer that has an audible ticking noise you can hear from across the room (not great if you put the fire on to relax), and the thermostat for the room is located near the fireplace so it triggers air conditioning when the fire is on if you don't adjust and then re-adjust when the fire goes out.

Usually the food is okay and they cook it to our liking which is rare to medium rare.  They have great Caesar salad, a rice pudding I really like except it's a bit too sweet lately, and good coffee.  Well, recently I've found the food so overly salty - I've ordered - no bacon (it's thick, tough and just awful - recooked from breakfast), no gravy, and still it was overly salty last time.  They also slather the veggies with an herbal butter whose flavour I detest although I do love my veggies.  Anyway, tonight I ordered the special (12.95 for two pieces of liver, salad, dessert and really substandard garlic bread included) as well as the baked potato and veggies.  Hold the bacon, hold the gravy and please do not add salt and butter to my meal.  The veggies were fine, ditto the baked potato although somewhat overcooked and brown inside.  The liver however was another story!!  No seasoning as requested however it arrived literally swimming in a puddle of oil, as well as the onions - Just swimming.  Worst of all it was so overcooked it was charred black all around the edges and very dark overall.  Overcooked?  Did I say overcooked, what I meant was - incinerated.   A good value at 12.95 all inclusive, but only if the meal is edible and you don't end up taking it home for dog!!  The service was 5 star, the food, well, NOT.  Especially after asking for it to be rare to medium rare since it turns into leather after that.  Between the heavy salt on the food, and tonight's greasy mess, well, don't think we'll be going back again.  I used my two napkins to soak up the oil as best I could but even so...  UGH.  I would have sent it back but we arrived late, 7:15, and they close at 8 pm.  By the time the meal was served there was no time to return food to the kitchen.  As for the rest of the menu, well, we've tried many items over the years - we used to live fairly close by, and the liver and onions is the ONLY thing we've ever gone back for.  Enough said.  I can only think the good reviews are due to the lower price point and the mountain of food served for the dollar.  Great as long as its decent and edible.

I must say this store does not have the appeal my idealogical childhood expected and maybe that is the problem.\n\nSure the selection and quantity of toys here is pretty good. Pretty darn good actually, it is the rest of the business that appears to need a reboot.

This place is run like a Costco except that at Costco the place is well taken care of and the staff is pretty switched on to their jobs. \n\nThis place is falling apart. The front of the store needed a repaint 5-10 years ago and really looks run down. This whole mall is depressing, but that is besides the point. The inside is also dirty and run down. I find the displays are all over the place and the whole place is a bit unkempt. \n\nThis is a children's store. It should be vibrant and upbeat. Clean is not a lot to ask for.\n\nOn the Babies R Us side, I think things are a little different. The staff seems to be more knowledgeable about the products they sell but only marginally. The warehouse layout continues however and the general malaise of the store continues.\n\nThe family room for changing or feeding babies is a nice touch and seems to be in okay shape, but not spectacular. \n\nOn a final note, the check out lines take forever.

(Any repairs would cost extra.  They failed me on my safety inspection, so I had to get the door fixed.) I asked them if there was any chance that the bill would be less than $84 if were to take less than an hour to diagnose.  I was told that the minimum labor charge would be for an hour, and that it would not be less.\n\nI told the repair guy that I would only consider returning to Canadian tire if it took me more than 5 minutes to diagnose the problem myself.  As expected, by popping of the rear door panel I was able to find the problem in about 4 minutes!  \n\nThe true \"hourly\" rate would have been much more than $84!  Furthermore, that particular car (a 94 volvo) has about one failure mode for the door handle (a flimsy connector joining the door handle to a metal rod going down to the lock): A mechanic experienced with Volvos would have immediately had a good idea what the problem was without looking. I ordered a used door handle from a toronto parts shop and screwed it on myself.\n\nI was also dismayed that they failed me on my nitrous oxide emissions (which were 50% above the allowed limit) and wanted $100 to diagnose the problem to determine whether my old volvo with 65K miles on it was worth repairing.   I asked them if they had heated up the engine before running the test, and they said it was at normal operating temperature.\n\nNot willing to take their word for it after their attempted fast one on the door lock, I took the car for a 10-minute warm up on the freeway and went to another emissions inspection station.  This time it sweaked by, no need to pay $100 to find out  what expensive repairs Canadian tire might want.

The co-ed gym replaced a really crappy but long established gym on Columbia in 2008 - so everything is pretty new.  \n\nWhere I'd dock them marks is that it gets ridiculously busy during busy periods and the weight area upstairs gets pretty crowded.   The density in general of the equipment seems to be higher than the Kitchener gyms. They are probably least busy right after 1.30 pm and after 10pm.

The place is so outdated; it looked like a scene from The Shining. All I could smell when I walked in the door was cigarette smoke. When I passed the salad bar it looked like none of the food had been changed in hours, maybe even days. When we were seated the first thing I noticed was a few dead flies in the window sill and about a quarter inch of dust on all the fake plants and the window sill. All the glassware and silverware were covered in smudges and fingerprints, which is one thing if you're eating at your local East Side's but at a restaurant where the average plate is $35.00-$40.00 or more I would expect clean cutlery and dishes at the very least. When the food came several of us had ordered the New York Striploin and yet no 2 plates looked the same. Some cuts of steak were thick and short, some were thin and long, they were all cooked rare even though they were all requested at different temperatures with one being well done. One of my fellow diners had to send her salmon back twice and it still wasn't cooked thoroughly so she gave up and ate the veggies, that quite frankly tasted frozen. When we told the waitress about the undercooked meals she seemed almost offended and was defensive about the issue and reluctant to take them back. Also I should say when the food was brought back to the kitchen it came back with the meat having been re-heated and the sides all cold.  All in all I would say this restaurant was a terrible waste of money and if it weren't for the good company the evening would have been a write off too.

As has been pointed out, there is lots of parking in the back off of Charles Street, and there is a rear entrance. The ambience is very utilitarian. There's a plastic tray on every table containing spoons, plastic chop sticks, condiments, and a dispenser of the thinnest napkins I've ever encountered. If you're looking for something classy, or romantic, go elsewhere.\n\nThanks to other reviews I was prepared for the \"fill out your order system\". I've seen this at other Vietnamese places, so there wasn't any learning curve for me. The menu is quite extensive, and there were a ton of Pho options. Honestly, I couldn't really tell the difference between a lot of the Pho choices, but my default is always the house special, and that's what I went with; along with a Jackfruit Milkshake. My companion had a vermicelli chicken dish, and we ordered an appetizer of a ground meat roll with sausage.\n\nGreen tea was brought to the table immediately, and was quite good. Our orders arrived very promptly, but not in any particular order. My Pho arrived first, then my companions entree, then the appetizer, then my shake. There's a door bell that sounds that alerts the server when an item is ready. It's a bit distracting, but you get used to it.\n\nMy Pho was delicious. I wasn't sure what size to get, and went with a large because I had a good appetite. I still wasn't able to finish it. I'll definitely only get a medium next time. There were generous portions of beef, tendon and tripe, along with noodles. I always add the additional sprouts, basil and lime, and plenty of chilies. I can't overstate how good this was. My companion enjoyed her dish as well, but I did not have a taste I can't comment. The appetizer was a mixed bag. The meat stuffed rolls were tasty, but difficult to separate, and the sausage came in thin slices along the side of the plate and was pretty good, reminiscent of baloney. Not exactly what I expected. My Jackfruit shake was very good, but super sweet. Definitely more of a dessert than anything.\n\nWhen you're finished eating, stroll up to the cash and give your table number, with is indicated by one of those gold and black number stickers you see at Canadian Tire. You don't get a bill brought to your table, so don't want around. Be sure to grab a fruit candy at the cash.\n\nOverall, the food impressed me, as well as the speed of service and the price.

It can be quite steamy inside the conservatory area on a hot and humid day so take that into account but there is a nice airconditioned indoor area which features extensive displays of pinned insects and butterflys with information.

From the moment I drove up to the entrance, I was greeted by a pleasant young man who offered to take my bags. Check-in was a breeze although a touch before the 4p.m. check-in time, they suggested a stroll around the property. \n\nThe Langdon Hall property is stunning, a tennis court for those itching for some exercise and a pool for lounging. The rose and vegetable garden were a joy to stroll through. While only about an hour outside of Toronto, it felt like I was transported to B&B in Napa.\n\nStrolling back into the main house, I was informed that my room was ready and my bags were already waiting for me in the room. The thought did cross my mind that the room was in fact ready when I initially checked in, but they wanted to provide an opportunity to peruse the property and to stow my bags in my room along with a lovely package of biscotti. The room was fantastic and spacious overlooking the rose garden in the cloister section of the property.\n\nNow onto the main event - FOOD!\n\nWhile some people love celebrities, I love chefs. And with Jonathan Gushue as the Master Chef at Langdon Hall, I knew I was in for a treat.\n\nSettling down, I was handed the menu along with a hefty wine list. Being the only somewhat drinker in my party, I was disappointed to see only full and half bottles on the list. A quick inquiry produced the wines-by-the-glass list. Heavy on the Ontario wines, I selected a 2008 Tawse Chardonnay. I will have to note though that the sommelier, while pleasant, quickly disappeared once she realized that we were not going to be consuming a significant amount of alcohol.\n\nChef Gushue's tasting menu features the freshest from local purveyors and his vegetable garden. While it was tempting, I had my eye on a few items not on the tasting. Instead we opted for mid-course to share. \n\nOrders placed, a basket of bread with in-house churned butter. Amazing fresh bread paired with even better butter. Let's just say I polished off an entire basket and used the bread as an accompaniment to the butter rather than vice versa.\n\nFor my appetizer, I selected the Butter Poached Lobster which tasted amazing and surprisingly light and fresh despite the richness of the lobster. \n\nI also conned one of my dining partners into sharing the Smoked Ham Hock and Foie Gras Presse with me as a mid-course. It arrive plated separately and was topped with a rose water liquid. Chunky, soupy and delicious it was the perfect balance of saltiness, sweetness from the rose water and creaminess from the foie gras.\n\nI'm always opposed to ordering two of the same thing at a restaurant, so when it came to ordering main courses, I had to flip for the duck breast. I lost, but ended up winning with the most delicate delicious lamb dish ever. Sourced from a local lamb farm, the lamb lacked the gamey flavour often found in New Zealand lamb and tasted almost like veal.\n\nNow onto the best part of the evening. As the diner who discriminates based on dessert menus, Landon Hall's had me intrigued. Torn between two dessert, the kitchen as a testament to their Relais & Chateaux level service managed to create smaller portions of two desserts. \n\nArriving on the same plate separated by a chocolate \"fence\", the Baked Chocolate Mousse was dense and rich with fresh strawberries providing the necessary touch of juicy tangy-ness. I have to say the strawberries tasted as real strawberries should and definitely made the dessert. But the epic, mind-blowing other half of the plate was the Milk Chocolate Silk with Caramel Corn and Sweet Corn Ice Cream. Silky smooth chocolate with crunchy, chewy, slightly salty caramel corn was easily the best dessert I've ever had. Words cannot describe how amazing this dessert was - don't walk, don't run, beam yourself to Langdon Hall for this dessert. \n\nAs if that wasn't enough, on the way out we ran into Executive Chef Jonathan Gushue. Chef-struck as I was, I stammered as I tried to convey my thanks and amazement of the meal. If he minded my stammering nonsense, he didn't elude to it as he handed me his personal business card and invited me to e-mail him the next time I planned to come. Hopefully next time I'll leave my stammering-self at home.", "business_id": "xQnZpvPqop1ZMXpAimb_Dg", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-09-13", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "oWPGsQ62pJsn5CIDAvx75A", "review_id": "Mrji234cTMsRvBDQqOFiUw", "text": "There is an undeniable rustic elegance about Langdon Hall that you feel immediately upon entering the grounds and driving past the vast expanse of finely manicured lawns en route to the covered entrance.\n\nUnlike many hotels of today Langdon Hall seems completely unique and separated from the world beyond. And this is a positive attribute. Every room is unique and different from the next. Fireplaces abound. Small sitting nooks and exposed beams in the guest rooms add a certain charm you won't find in any large chain hotel - despite their best efforts to replicate the feeling.\n\nThe grounds are really spectacular and warrant exploration. I didn't do nearly enough as I was there for work but the short walks were worthwhile and I only lament not having time for further constitutionals along the grounds.\n\nThe food is absolutely top notch. Many of the fresh herbs and vegetables are grown on the grounds which is interesting but only if the quality is high. And I can assure you the quality is the highest. After three days at the hotel I ate a fair bit and nothing (short of a foie gras beignet) was short of delicious.\n\nThere is also a spa at the resort which I didn't get the chance to use but if it matches the quality of the hotel and the food I'm certain it's not disappointing.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a place to get away from the world, relax, be surrounded in luxury, be pampered by an ultra attentive staff this is the place for you.", "business_id": "xQnZpvPqop1ZMXpAimb_Dg", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-09-17", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}, "user_id": "5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA", "review_id": "UQnoL5ITmyhhit-oJNqwWg", "text": "Full review blogged.  Good, not great.  Highlights below.\n\nThe Why:  The Number One hotel in Canada according to some sources - Five Diamonds, Relais et Chateau Rated, an off-the-beaten path gem, and an ever changing menu crafted by Chef Jonathan Gushue focused on the best local ingredients available - it seemed a perfect way to end our trip spanning from Toledo to Montreal and back.\n\nThe Service:  Elegant and formal but decidedly lacking the polish and charm of many similar restaurants I was actually somewhat surprised by the fact that only a single captain and server were working the room that evening.  Perhaps an effect of the season or low number of diners there were periods where water went unfilled, plates sat empty, and presentations were bobbled that I simply would not expect from a restaurant of such stature.\n\nLavender White Hot Chocolate:  Generally not a fan of floral flavors this was highly recommended by our server and actually quite excellent, a light perfume of lavender with rich smooth sipping chocolate.\n\nDressed Rabbit with duck liver mousse and Endive:  In my opinion the best bite of the evening, this complementary amuse was perfect - the lean tartare of rabbit melded together by the creamy foie gras while endive and crisp onions kept it vibrant.\n\nHouse White and Wheat Bread with Salted Aged Butter:  A top ten all time bread service, particularly considering there was only two options - the quality here was in the butter.  Rich and decadent - literally as flavorful as an aged cheese and as good as many in Paris I really have no idea how much of this I ate, but I do know the bread was replenished twice and the butter thrice...and I don't think the ladies were responsible.\n\nPotato Fondue, Basil, Herb Chips, Sallers:  This was awesome - probably more butter than potato and beautifully accented with the herbal elements while the crispy root vegetables added texture.\n\nLobster, Partridgeberry Jus, Baby Beets, Parsnip, Red Onion, Rainbow Chard:  My aunt's selection and everything the cod tongue could have been - perfectly executed lobster in a vegetal melange that reminded me of the cuisine out in northern California in terms of its freshness, refinement, and balance.  At times bitter, at others earthy, but all the time with a slight overlying sweetness that played off the natural flavors of the shellfish.\n\nRoe Deer, Chickweed, Venison Bacon, Navet, Mustard Greens, Sunflower Crumble, Natural Jus:  My selection - served medium-rare by Chef's choice - was small in portion but impressively lean and perfectly gamey, but even cooked perfectly still a bit dry.  Having bathed other proteins in sauces and broths it is hard for me to determine why Gushue opted to go with largely dry accoutrements on this plate given the natural leanness of small deer but all-in-all it was a poor choice, particularly at a $44 price tag.\n\nDark Chocolate Toffee Bar with Coco Nibs, Soused Cherry Ice Cream:  By far the best of the desserts that afternoon, this was dry like a Kit-Kat yet melted like a semifreddo on the tongue.  Bittersweet but bolstered by the intensely sour ice cream everything here from temperature to texture to taste was nicely balanced.\n\nPine Scented Lemon Sponge Cake with Toasted Marshmallow and Citrus Frozen Yogurt:  My mother ordered this for the citrus...she enjoyed it.  To me it tasted much like Pine-sol smells.  Texturally interesting to be sure, but most assuredly not my style.\n\nThe Verdict:  In many ways befitting of its tremendous accolades I couldn't help but depart Langdon Hall a bit disappointed.  For many reasons a 'destination meal,' including location, sourcing, and setting the simple fact of the matter was that for over $100/pp after tax and tip there were just too many uninspiring courses at too much cost.  While I don't doubt that both the front of the house and Chef Gushue's team in the kitchen can turn out an exemplary experience at Langdon Hall it would be hard for me to guarantee it to anyone based on my one experience and even harder for me to justify a return visit unless I otherwise found myself in the area.", "business_id": "xQnZpvPqop1ZMXpAimb_Dg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-11-12", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 1}, "user_id": "H7yzpU66M-nnHj0R6eh2ww", "review_id": "hqx_QEooVN_fEVBU2eEQuA", "text": "We spent the holidays at Langdon Hall and never wanted to leave.

We had lunch in the Wilks Bar the first afternoon. there are fireplaces everywhere. I got cozy by a fireplace and caught up on emails while my husband and son played pool.

Pig Cheek poutine, Caramelized Onion soup, Burratta and beet salad, Fresh halibut and chips, even the kids burger and fries were amazing....\n\nBreakfast was more off the same quality. Farm fresh Country Breakfast with locally sourced cheeses, yogurt and Langdon maple granola, house made charcuterie and smoked salmon, freshly baked scones and home made preserves. Pumpkin frittata and Brioche French toast with vanilla bourbon syrup.........AMAZING\n\nThe service everywhere on property was exemplary!\n\nDinner was certainly the highlight of the trip and Chef Jonathan Gushue was in the kitchen.

My partner and I enjoy staying at the Relais & Ch\u00e2teau portfolio of properties because you know what to expect, and Langdon Hall does not disappoint on that score. \n\nThe service was very friendly and comprehensive, and we didn't want for much while we were there.

The robes were fantastic.  Perhaps the only quibble I have is that there are no personal toiletries and instead pump cans for shampoo and body wash; having big canisters of shampoo latched to the wall didn't really fit in with the vibe that the gorgeous room was giving out.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend a visit to Langdon Hall.

It was \"crazy adorable\" to quote my chicka. She puts up with me, she truly does. We came up here for a business meeting and I didn't find too much in the way of reviews, so I decided we would wing it. We constantly travel and finding a hotel off the highway normally not an issue.\n\nWhat up Canada???? We drove up the 401 and could not believe that there was not more than a hotel or two between Windsor & Waterloo. FYI - don't drive too long and get sleepy, you might find yourself snoozing in your car for lack of accommodations en-route.\n\nSo we drove around Windsor and found the cuteness that is King st. My chicka was getting annoyed, & finally made me go into the Waterloo hotel and look around. Apparently I had made the mistake so many others have.... I saw reviews for another hotel with a similar name in the area that were not so hot & thought it was this hotel. \n\nI was wrong!\n\nFirst off the desk clerk could not have been nicer. She was incredibly nice and welcoming.\n\nOur room was the music suite. It was beautiful, and had a gas fireplace which we enjoyed.  The decor was beautiful.\n\nThe bed was very comfortable, there were nice touches like chocolates on the pillows, free wifi and an in room refrigerator with a couple of bottles of water. The owners also had documented the story of the hotel and press releases in a interesting book on the desk which definitely answered all our questions. \n\nAs business travelers we needed a few things. Ironing board and iron - not in the room but the front desk lady (who I wish I remembered her name, because she was awesome!) brought it up to our room\n\nRestaurant recommendation. Again our awesome front desk lady took care of us. She recommended a restaurant and even followed up by calling to make sure it was open because it was the holiday \"Family Day\". \n\nThe con's....\n\nThe attached restaurant does not allow a glass or two of wine to leave in order to enjoy the wonderful, romantic room by the fireplace... much to my chicka's annoyance. She thought she was gonna get a romantic moment or two savoring a glass of wine toasting our toes in Victorian elegance. Sorry babe... didn't happen.\n\nBlow dryer... it needs upgrading. Not enough power.\n\nCounter space... my chicka is a beautiful woman but somehow requires loads of product which she managed to squish onto a tiny wicker table in the bathroom. There was a huge mirror on the beautiful antique dresser in the main room, but not enough light.\n\nGame changer....\n\nHoly freaking NOISE!!!!!!!!!!!! \n\nWe are from downtown Chicago, IL USA 60654... there is honking, EL train, sirens, bar & restaurant, neighbor, dogs, whatever,  etc noise constantly. \n\nFor us to find something noisy, it is LOUD!

The beds are insanely comfortable as well.\n\nThe negatives are that there is almost no staff, and if you have a room on the top floor, you have to lug your own luggage up several flights of stairs because there is no elevator. They also have no restaurant or room service. They used to have a deal with the restaurant next door so you could at least have your breakfast there. Now, they give you coupons for a restaurant a block away (which is kind of like a Starbucks--not a restaurant at all).\n\nConsidering it's quite a bit pricier than, say, the Best Western, you'd think you'd be accommodated more in terms of staff and restaurant service. \n\nFor all it's quaintness, I'm afraid I'm too old to drag my luggage up flights of stairs. I'm also too old to be giving a coupon to a guy in a coffee shop for my breakfast--that part is just embarrassing (and, frankly, we just ended up tossing the coupons after the first day and having a nice hot breakfast in the restaurant next door).\n\nOh, and the worst part: the internet is very spotty if you stay above the second floor!

This place in particular, located in the plaza right beside University of Waterloo, is the best pizza place you can go for under a budget.\n\nGenerally speaking, their pizzas are great in taste and size. Most of the time they will have pizzas that are freshly out of the oven. If you go at a time where the particular type of pizza you want is not not available, they can make it for you on the fly in about 15min.\n\nIn terms of selection of toppings, they've got quite a diversity. You won't find any exotic toppings there, but they've got most of the ordinary ones covered.\n\nOne great thing I like about Pizza Nova is their Sunday deal. For the price of ~$15, you get three(3) medium sized pizzas with the toppings of your choice.

Tuesday night they have discount nights with tickets being almost half-price and they're even cheaper if you're a SCENE member.

For six years I've had to endure a city with a makeshift coffee culture. To make matters worse, my Coop terms take me to Seattle and New York to enjoy the best cafe culture around only to yank me back to KW every 4 months.\n\nToday I'm enjoying an Americano on King Street in Uptown Waterloo. Any other day I would be at Heuther's or my oh-so-favorite Second Cup. Not today. On the corner of Dupont & King there is a fresh infusion of coffee culture into mundane Uptown life.\n\nThis new cafe is appropriately called Coffee Culture and I have the best seat in the house! It's the red leather couch in the corner by the window. I can see the little old ladies in the street plastering their faces into the window wondering what this new place is. After walking away they are back literally 10 minutes later with their husbands to try it out.  \n\nThe lineup was short but the wait time was long. The cashier was new so I forgive him. I took in the menu instead. Oddly it's spread out the whole length of the bar making it hard to read everything while standing in line. After ordering and taking my super awesome seat the barista came by. She asked me exactly how much water I'd like in my Americano. It might not seem like special treatment but it is. The last time I had this custom a coffee made for me it was at bauhaus in trendy hipster Seattle.\n\nThe prices are low priced to fair here. I have a feeling they will rise to match everyone. Coffee shops are always more expensive to run than initially thought as well. Still, they are definitely competitive with Starbucks, Second Cup, Heuther Hotel and even Timmies. They have plenty of food. If I had money to spare I'd try it out. Though, the smell of it is enough to convince me to come back!\n\nThe place is sparkling clean. Sure to please my parents when they come for a visit. They never did like the grungy hipster makeshift house cafe's I generally drag them to. The couches are leather and the chairs and tables real wood - not plasticy Timmies style - though you knew that by now. They even have a nice big screen television so I can enjoy a game while getting some work done - free wifi hurrah!\n\nOh look, even a cop walked in to try it out.

We (me and 2 other girls) were seated in the bar area, and I remember it being really upscale with great service, good cocktails and delicious flatbread (I had ordered the one with smoked salmon, but coming back this time, I was disappointed to see that it was no longer offered on the menu).\n\nI came here again yesterday on a date with my boyfriend. This time we were seated in the dining area ... right in the middle. We were literally surrounded by other tables which took away that \"intimate, romantic\" feel that we expected from Wildcraft. I mean, Wildcraft has a huge dining area (a main floor, a bar/lounge area, and a basement) so I don't get why they have to cram so many dining tables in the area. We  went on a Friday at 7:30PM and the main floor alone wasn't even 75% full.\n\nThe food was alright. The price is in the $20 to $35 dollar range for an entree. Of course, you can always opt for a flatbread which costs around $15 and is pretty filling/delicious. We ordered:\n1.

Service was excellent and they wisely assigned several 'helpers' in addition the main waiter.  I also appreciated that they didn't force an automatic tip.... this actually resulted in them getting a higher tip than they might have otherwise. \n\nFood was delicious, and in the Kitchener-Waterloo area it's one of the nicer places.  But it is fairly 'standard'.  Steaks, Pizzas, Chicken, etc... nothing particularly unique/exotic.  Think \"Keg\"... but a touch better. I'm from Toronto so I'm spoiled a bit and expect all sorts of creative twists... but for a really good basic meal it was fine. \n\nI personally found the prices a bit high for what we got... but again, that might be a bit of a Waterloo supply/demand thing. \n\nThe one thing however that I should give a nod to is the wine program.  I was REALLY impressed with what their somelier team has put together.  The wine list includes a good variety (not just ontario/italy) of unique (not just cab, shiraz, merlot, chard) options. Many are offered in 3oz, 6oz, options (this seemed a bit weird to me... I like the more standard 5/6oz, and a 9oz upgrade).  I found some of the prices, again, a touch high (many 3oz were what I might pay for a full glass in TO). \n\nInterestingly for by-the-bottle wines, they offer to \"open any bottle and serve it by the glass if you buy min. of 2 glasses\"... that I found was kind of neat and much appreciated.  2 glasses is nothing to sweat, but a full bottle can be over the top (for 1 person on a random weekday).  This program makes some of the reserve wines much more accessible...and, I imagine, results in lots of \"bin ends\" for other customers making it even more accessible and interesting.   I love this idea and wish more resto's would follow suit.", "business_id": "-GR4Dvxhx6ddaDiUICOSFQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-01-27", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "-Bz9LT23bEe5cnWxsaGBgw", "review_id": "IxL9z0ABzSiZEbk1qSnR5g", "text": "I've been coming to Bauer since it opened and my last visit on Friday evening compelled me to finally review it. As many have mentioned, they have a great wine list and a decent cocktail menu. But, also mentioned by many others, the noise level is an issue at times. I'd never found it loud in the past, but on Friday they had a DJ spinning crummy beats, at 9:00 p.m. Many people were eating dinner and it made our table a bit too loud to enjoy conversation. I feel like it would be advisable to save the DJ and loud music until 11:00 or so, when most people are just having drinks and want a more bar-y atmosphere.\n\nAs for the food, Bauer has several great dishes and has even recently updated the menu. My only complaint about the food is that the menu leans towards being a bit heavy, and lacks a good dinner salad, something that similar places in town generally cover well. The short rib gnocchi is always a favourite, as is the seafood appetizer plate (though that may be off the menu now). Desserts are pretty good, though they don't have much in the way of gelato selection.\n\nIt's ideal for dinner, but service can be a bit slow around brunch and lunch. We went there for brunch a couple years ago and our friend ordered the freshly squeezed OJ. The waitress informed him that it was not fresh but bottled, and it still ran $5.

The fine dining landscape has certainly improved in little over 4 years (or 5...my oh my I'm ageing at a rapid rate). However, with age comes an appreciation for the finer things in life such as good food, good wine, good company, etc. So I guess this is why my overall experience at The Bauer Kitchen was so amazing!\n\nThis place impressed me from the moment we walked in. The d\u00e9cor was beautifully elegant while maintaining a certain rugged appeal. Dark stained wood tables paired with Ostrich skin covered seats made for a unique combination going with the overall stylish and sophisticated ambience. But don't be scared off by my description, you don't need to wear a members jacket to dine here. The Bauer is still trendy enough for jeans and a t-shirt. Lets call it casual fine dining\n\nThe menu was a welcome surprise as well. Catering to every taste it was very eclectic. The one thing I liked best is while maintaining certain fine dining staples, the Bauer had found was at making simple foods such as Pizza and Burgers, just this side of classy, using premium ingredients and cooking process. Yumm!\n\nI decided to start my meal with a pint of Mill Street Organic (always a automatic +1 star for any establishment who carries my fav beer on tap). \n\nFor my appetizer I had what was referred to as a Romaine salad. It was like a Caesar salad BUT with a freshly made garlic dressing, fresh croutons AND the best part being the slow cooked smoked strips of bacon which tasted the way a camp-fire smells. ..... Just drooled in my mouth a little (sorry)\n\nMoving on, for my main course I decided to call this restaurant out on the fine portion of their \"fine dining\" claim, and ordered their Duck Confit. I asked the waiter for his honest opinion of the dish and he said it was wildly popular and told me to it was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. SOLD GAR\u00c7ON!!\n\nThe duck was served exactly as promised, deliciously crispy and moist. It was served with mixed veggies, steamed and grilled, and fingerling potatoes seasoned and cooked to soft perfection.\n\nAll of my waiters recommendations were spot on for dinner and his service was impeccable. He even made a great after dinner shot suggestion when we asked for tequila. For any of you who have never tried Cabo Wabo tequila, do it! Perfect after dinner shot to help you digest (or make you forget you are full), smooth and actually tasty :)\n\nThis experience came with an expected price tag of about $60-70 per person, which I can justify for fine dining. However, if you are looking for a cheap meal I recommend you try one of the other fine establishments on King St. But if you have the extra bucks, hit The Bauer Kitchen up, well worth it.", "business_id": "-GR4Dvxhx6ddaDiUICOSFQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-06-12", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "aQYNUROkOwPxEe-TMxtvPw", "review_id": "KUIMGmzGPjwTq2gToS0xiw", "text": "My wife and I made a reservation for a Friday night to check out Bauer Kitchen for the first time.  We showed up early to have a beer at the bar and to take in the atmosphere a little bit.  We both really loved the feel of the place, dimly lit, dark woods, little rustic yet with a slight polish.  Bartender was very nice and friendly, quick to serve us and was able to suggest a beer that was really good.\n\nWe were seated right on time.  We had trouble deciding on our meals, though the menu is small everything seemed very appealing.  While at the bar we had eaves dropped the special for the night however when it came time for us to order the special had run out.  Our waitress said she had never seen a special go so quickly.  We were given 2 rolls/buns while we made our way through the menus.  We decided on the poutine to start which was VERY good.  Not your typical poutine at all.  Reminded me of a mix between sausage and biscuits and poutine...again, very good.\n\nFor mains my wife had the beef tenderloin with mashed potatoes and I had the braised short rib which was recommended by our very nice and patient waitress.  My wife was really impressed with the tenderloin, extremely tender and cooked to her liking.  The mashed potatoes could have had a little more pizazz in them though.  My short rib was good, very tender.  There was a sauce or reduction or something on top of it that put me off at the beginning, could just be my taste buds.  As I ate more and more the odd taste dissipated.  We would both recommend what we ate to others.\n\nWay too full for dessert so can't comment on that.  \n\nWe will certainly be going back.

For a place in Waterloo, this place exudes class and urbanity that is severely lacking in other restaurants. The service we received was great, good at confirming vegetarian options with the kitchen, and the wine list was well above average. \n\nThe food was good, but it wasn't great. I ordered the funghi pizza and the vegetarian gnocchi, with a salad (all split with someone) and french onion dip to start for the table. The pizza tasted good, but the crust was very hard around the edge and the center was floppy. I normally compare pizza to Libretto or Terroni in Toronto as a baseline, and this didn't come even remotely close. As I said, it tasted good, but it wasn't outstanding. It was cheesy and salty and the caramelized onions were very flavourful, but it was more along the lines of something you'd order at Milestones. The gnocchi was also quite good, but the cooked celery kinda threw me off. It didn't taste bad, and the gnocchi (from vincenzo's down the street) was done nicely, however the dish didn't justify the $17 price tag. \n\nThe salad (with roasted vegetables, can't remember the name of it) was actually really good. We mentioned that we would be splitting it and they brought out 2 half portions, which is always a nice touch. The French onion cheese dip was nothing more than a bunch of melted cheese mixed with caramelized onions. Again, the salty cheesy taste was good, but not original or outstanding. The dish relied on it's ability to satiate your pallet with sodium and fat and read more like a standard spinach artichoke dip than \"French onion\". \n\nThe Charcoal Group seems to be locking down the KW fine restaurant scene. The proliferation of their restaurant brand is evident in the feeling of The Bauer Kitchen resembling a somewhat nicer Milestones. It's not chainy feeling in the same way East Side's is, it's chainy feeling like O&B (Oliver and Bonacini) or Milestones is - original decoration, but produced by the huge success of their other restaurants. There's nothing wrong with this, but it feels \"produced\" rather than a reflection of the owner or chef. \n\nI'm honestly excited about the new restaurant scene in KW. I visit family here a number of times per year, so having dinner options is always welcome.

The beautiful industrial interior with touches of a barn/country motif. Menu items with slight twists like banh mi burgers and duck wings. But when it comes down to it, the food is good, but not great. It's missing the wow factor that brings me back to a place.\n\nWe started with the hoison glazed chicken tacos with carrot, cilantro, daikon, etc. Pretty much all the things you would find on a banh mi. It had the tastes of a banh mi, but maybe could have packed more punch. It was solid, but not a must try.\n\nI tried to order the lamb special, but they were already soldout at 8pm. Too bad. So I opted to try the short rib instead. This was definitely a big piece of meat. It was very tender. I enjoyed the play on steak frites. The short rib was prepared like a roast beef with jus, horseradish and mushrooms. Problem with the dish is that it lacks balance. Not much sweetness or acidity in that piece of meat. Could have used a wine or more wine in the braising to bring that. Or perhaps a beet or fruit element. Maybe even the side could be sweet, but the fries were just salty as well like the meat. I loved that the piece of meat was big, but there wasn't enough sauce to accompany such a big piece.\n\nHad the white chocolate brulee for dessert. Definitely no complaints. I liked it, but I don't think I'll be talking about it after this review.\n\nI think the issue with the restaurant is they are more worried with appearing trendy than actually being trendy. They spent a lot of time on the modern space and they really pump the music up. Though if the food is great, you really don't need that. If I went back, I would probably try at lunch when it might be quieter.

I used to work in a Sports Bar and I know for a fact I would have immediately offered new wings or at least a credit to the bill. Instead she offered nothing, so my friend ate nothing and we paid and left. I will go back because I have had better experiences there in the past but all in all the customer service was not good.

I'm not generally picky about things like this, but the lighting was so bizarre and dim, and the ceiling felt unusually low - I felt like I was a mole stopping for some food whilst digging my way through an underground tunnel. There was a row of seating by the window and a couple of high-top tables, which seemed really sparse given the space. There was a huge menu posted on one wall, and after a cursory glance at it, my sister went for the bean and cheese, and I chose the halibut, after reading the rave reviews about it for another location of Burrito Boyz. \n\nOur burritos were customized to order, and then tossed on the grill. The whole process was a bit lengthier than I had expected, about 10 minutes or so from start to finish. I was apprehensive about the grilling of my burrito, and rightfully so (not to mention that, to my dismay, two people handled my burrito with their bare hands, despite there being a box of gloves sitting in plain sight!). Once I received my hot and hefty bundle and bit into it, it tasted far more like a \"wrap\" than a burrito. There really was very little that felt \"Mexican\" about it. The ingredients were fresh enough, and the hot sauce had a nice kick, but apart from that, it didn't hit the spot. Additionally, the halibut tasted a bit greasier than I had expected. It was disappointing on the burrito side of things, but it was a reasonably priced and filling meal.\n\nAdditional note: most of the clientele, along with the employees, seemed to be small groups of university students.

I feel like this was to capture the weekend partying from Phil's and probably does a good job at handling the volume. \n\nThe pricing was a bit confusing as they do not offer two different tortilla sizes, instead the sizes indicated the amount of filling used. \nI got a small bean burrito without the cheese, and extra spicy w/ the works. \nPricing was good and comparable to Bandidos! Meaning big fat's is still the most expensive of the three. \n\nThe cook time felt longer than Bandidos and they also do not use a flat press to help with the grilling do maybe that's why it took longer to cook while coming out fairly soft. I enjoyed the softness of the burrito, though personally I do enjoy a slightly crunchier wrap. The longer cook time might be a liability during the post club rush =/ just a thought. \n\nI felt that the initial bite was underwhelming as the tortilla wasn't proportional to the quantity of filling, they really should get two sizes of tortilla.

Both of us got the home made Swiss melt burgers, one with fries.  The burgers are generous and very flavourful.  The problem is the SALT... SALT and more SALT.  I asked for fried onions and mushrooms and my partner did as well.  Well, they made only enough for one burger, so my burger was left literally flaming on the grill while he made more for me ( maybe one tablespoon of each and hard to find in the burger!).  They forgot to put my bun on to toast so it was held to the grill while he heated it, and again my poor burger was still sitting on the grill, not off to the side, but in flames.  Did I mention the burger was very overcooked and charred and tough?  My partner's burger was cooked nicely, which is strange since the orders went in together. My partner got the multi grain bun and it was soft, warm and doughy. Both buns got soggy real quick from not being toasted properly.  In addition my burger was drowning in mayo...  really - a triple helping of mayo.  The fries were awful.  Many were limp like a wet noodle, not crisp at all and again the SALT!!!  We couldn't eat them.  Tried brushing the salt off a little, but seriously - I have never seen so much salt on fries in my life, not even at Macdonalds!  So very disappointing.  All that being said since we lack good burgers in K-W and Little Louie's is a long drive and not open weekends, we might try it again IF we can get them to leave off adding more salt to the burgers while they are on the grill.  The salt content they add to their home made meat mixture is MORE than enough to put anyone into hospital with kidney failure.  They do a roaring business in poutine apparently, not my favorite choice, but I can't imagine it being much good with all the gravy on fries that are already limp and soggy.  VERY disappointed.  On the plus side the servers are helpful, quick to explain the choices and very friendly.

His name was Edgar Gingrich and he seemed really passionate about his product and family business. He had different variations of maple syrup, ranging from light to strong in flavor. After sampling some of the different ones, I decided to purchase the medium flavor one for some friends. You can definitely taste the difference in quality as compared to traditional big company produced versions.\n\nOther than that?

It was very good the first time, but I have to agree with the last couple of reviewers who spoke of frozen semi-potato things as opposed to home fries or real potatoes. The first time I went was about a year ago and it was REALLY good. I had the country style eggs benny (they had like 5 different kinds of eggs benedict at the time), which came with real fries and a fresh-looking \"fruit boat\". This time I was surprised to see they only had one kind of eggs benny, the classic peameal bacon on an english muffin, and the eggs fluorentine, which my friend ordered. I decided I would look at the lunch menu. \n\nSince moving to Ontario I have not had a decent poutine, and was craving one, so I asked our server if their poutine was real poutine with curds, not just fries and gravy with shredded cheese (which seems to be what people in Ontario think poutine is). I was assured that it was. So I ordered the club wrap (which I didn't really want, but didn't want just a heaping plate of fries for lunch). Our server then went on her break. We were served by two other servers. My friend's eggs fluorentine looked really good, but I was surprised at the gross looking potato things that accompanied it instead of their delicious home fries. \n\nMy \"poutine\", of course, was fries and gravy with shredded mozzarella cheese. I immediately said \"whoa - there's no curds\". One of the servers said that they don't have curds. I told them this isn't poutine then, and I specifically asked our original server and she said they serve it with curds. They apologized and said they didn't. I told them I didn't really want it then. The second server asked if I would like just fries or fries and gravy. I said no, that now I didn't really know what I wanted because I only ordered for the poutine really. So they unprofessionally rolled their eyes at me and took the plate away, saying they would bring me the menu again. About 10 minutes later I saw the two servers taking new orders at booths around us. One shouted across the restaurant at me that the other one will bring me a menu in a few minutes, after we had made eye contact. Niice. \n\nAfter another 5-10 minutes our original server came back and brought me a menu. I decided to just order the eggs benedict. The server apologized for her mistake, and explained that she thought that their poutine had curds since she is new and saw melted cheese so thought they were curds (which is strange since curds don't really melt, but whatever). She then said that \"the cook can't understand why you don't want the club wrap at all\". So as I explained before, I told her I had ordered it to accompany a side of poutine, which is what I really wanted. She kind of huffed and puffed and took off as soon as I ordered the eggs. \n\nEventually my food came out (my friend having already finished her meal), and the server apologized again. The eggs benny were meh. The hollandaise sauce was delicious, but the english muffin was not toasted. It was even kind of cold and dry. The \"potatoes\" were nasty, and the fruit boat was full of wilted, unwashed fruit. Delish... Afterward when we were paying, I noticed that the server read the debit receipt right in front of me before saying goodbye/thanks/etc., undoubtedly to see how much I tipped or if I did. I did not because of the poor service and food quality. \n\nThey get 2 stars because the hollandaise was good and the first time I went there the food and service were awesome.

Pretty simple stuff.\n\nWe split a pitcher of Rolling Rock. The beer tasted watered down. Both draft glasses were chipped. It took 25 minutes + for the nachos to arrive and they were nothing special. Blob on some salsa (not the good salsa, the cheap out of a jar of no name brand type methinks). Throw on the shredded cheese, some green onions, some olives call it $12.

We next saw him eating lunch at the bar. It seemed odd to me that employees ate in the dining area guests were in, but this isn't the Royal York so okay... next we saw a cook eating in the dining room as well.

Anyone who likes pizza will enjoy this dish and it's a nice twist.\n\nThe food is well made, cooked to order, tasty and a different option than your usual pita and faux-Canadian-Chinese food found at the plaza. \n\nMy only complaint (and the reason I ding'd a star) is that service is a bit slow, it takes about 20-30 minutes for your order to come out. It's not fast food, but i'd rather wait a while for fresh food than get soggy heat-lamp buffet table stuff from other places at the plaza.

As a result, my experiences vary widely. \n\nThis Pho Dau Bo is in a newish plaza, and the restaurant itself is clearly also quite new. The decor is pleasant and modern, but not otherwise mention-worthy. One tip: if you're going there in the winter, it can be a bit chilly, especially at the tables near the door. I'd recommend the inner row of tables instead. \n\nThe food was decent--I had a bowl with a skewer of meatballs, a spring roll and \"vermicelli\" (rice noodles that are thinner than the usual, udon-like ones, but aren't really as thin as vermicelli). Pretty good, I guess. The meatballs were fine--a little dry. They had a unique flavour to them, but it wasn't strong enough for my tastes, so I dipped them in various sauces for a bit more flavour. The spring roll was tasty--I quite liked that! The vermicelli was kind of bland--it didn't come already tossed in a sauce or anything, so I added to it, from the sauces on the table and the small bowl of sauce they gave me, which they said I was supposed to add to the noodles. It wasn't a new favourite, but it wasn't horrible, either. I'll keep hunting on future visits to Vietnamese restaurants, I think.\n\nMy companion had Pad Thai, and he liked it well enough, though he did say that the Pad Thai taste aesthetic that Vietnamese restaurants pursue seems to be quite different from what he's had at Thai restaurants (though there's also a fair bit of variance from one Pad Thai prep to another in general, and even among Thai restaurants). He prefers the style made at Thai restaurants, but this was pretty tasty as well. So it was a thumbs up from him. \n\nThe restaurant was pretty busy, of a Sunday afternoon--not super big, but still well-frequented--when we came, there were maybe a couple of tables (in the drafty part of the restaurant) empty, and by the time we left, it was full. Not a table to spare.  So, it may be that this is a local favourite, and I just have yet to find *the* dish that will make me want to keep coming back for more! \n\nI don't have kids, but there were quite a few kids there, with their families, and they seemed fairly kid friendly.

Something I find a bit annoying for a lot of all you can eat sushi places, though it's undoubtedly to keep the costs down for lunch, is that you you can't order sashimi at lunch with lunch costing $12.99 / person pre-tax and pre-tip.  \n\nWhat I liked the most from this place were the beef skewers (it was ordered towards the end so I probably had fairly low expectations by that point) with possibly the scariest looking dish being the spicy salmon pizza - which as noted, it appeared as if the salmon was soggy. The rolls were generally too loose which made them look sort of odd (pictured as uploaded).  To be fair, the food tasted ok though salty at times (too much soy sauce on the dragon rolls?).

It was a Friday night so it was relatively busy but it's a bit farther from the university areas so it probably sees less of a crowd than other places. \n\nThe ordering menu consists of two separate sheets of paper, one for kitchen items like beef skewers (yum!) and cheese wontons which the other one is for sashimi and sushi rolls.\n\nIf you're going to order a drink, it's refillable for all of the pops except for Nestea. Sorry Nestea drinkers.\n\nThe food itself was fabulous and I don't think there's actually a point in listing all of the rolls my group ordered because they were devoured within minutes. We didn't even get a chance to Instagram the meal. But definitely try out the Green Dragon and Toronto rolls. The Toronto roll has banana and it may seem weird at first but damn is it delicious.\n\nBut what all this is leading up to is the highlight of Sushi 99 - the food speed. I shit you not, we got our food about 5 minutes after we gave our waitress the order. I think we were all a little shocked by the speed and it might have actually taken longer for us to eat the dishes than it took for it to get to our table. I don't know what kind of sushi Oompa Loompas they've got back there in the kitchen but I was very very pleasantly surprised. You honestly never have to wait more than 10 minutes for your food and that's not usual for an AYCE sushi place at all. \n\nOkay, last point - the sashimi pieces are cut smaller than most places, I actually think that 2 of the S99 pieces would equal one of any other place but that's not an issue for AYCE.

There's nothing worse then rushing out to lunch, only to return to the office to realize that it's missing a topping you requested, or that it's not even the panini you ordered! Considering how busy Mambella's gets at lunch, you can reasonably expect to be in and out in under ten minutes. Quality food and fast. What more can you ask for from a lunchtime restaurant? \n\nTHE GREAT\n\nMambella's offers a variety of options for the Italian-lover's craving. From fresh salads, flavourable soups, and 'out of this world' panini's.

I've always said that you can judge an Italian panini restaurant by it's veal sandwich, and Mambella's hits this one out of the park.\n\nAs a panini lover, I often enjoy the opportunity to customize my own. Mambella's offers you the choice to make your own panini and top it with any of the toppings they have available. So if you can't decide between they panini's they already offer, you can always ask for some mortadella, capicollo, hot sopressata, on a fresh bun and top it with a few slices of provolone or whatever your heart desires. \n\nTHE OTHER FINE DETAILS\n\nMambella's is all about flexibility and customer service. If you know you've only got a small window for lunch, Mambella's gives you the option of calling in your order in advance so that it's ready for when you arrive.

No cutlery, you just pick the meat up with the bread. The meat was so good. You could tell they were lean cuts of meat, but they weren't tough. It was cooked well and the sauce kept it from going dry. Now, we don't like the taste of sourdough bread, so that was just our own fault for not doing research. But by what we saw, everything was really authentic and well-made. It came with a simple side salad of shredded romaine. I don't know what was in that oil-based dressing, but it was really good and I ate all of it.\n\nSince it was just him working, it was sometimes hard tracking him down because he would be cleaning something behind the bar or in the back.

This Waterloo bakeshop serves up some authentic tartines, macarons, tarts and Viennoiserie.  We came for lunch and each ordered a Tartine which is pretty much an open faced sandwich on their house made baguette.  Mine came topped with salami, spinach, and cheddar.  I loved the salami, it was thicker cut than usual, and the best part of the sandwich was that it had a tiny amount of fig jam, which helped cut the saltiness from the meat and cheese.  There are not too many bakeries outside of Toronto that bake macarons, thankfully they do at Sabletine.  That day they had three flavours, cassis, chocolate, and pistachio.  The best for me was the cassis, i got a slight hint of the currant in the filling and i loved the purple coloured shell.  The chocolate had a great shell, but the filling tasted just like melted chocolate, instead of a buttercream or ganache.  The last was the pistachio, it had great flavour, but the shell was blue which is an appetite suppressant, and the filling was great but also had an off putting colour.  \n\nOverall i had a great time at Sabletine, i think they are a legit bakery, and i cannot wait to go back for another tartine and a few macarons.", "business_id": "tnnG9W2K-rOP0i8K1LOCmQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-02-29", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "ho2eDuE6Cg0-StmkyUIHxw", "review_id": "sj9adsRMK96vixgOHnW3Uw", "text": "I came to Sabletine a month ago, and was so impressed that i had found a great lunch place that also serves up some of the best baked goods in the area.  We were at the restaurant shortly after noon, and were debating between a few of their lunch items that were written on the chalkboard.  After pondering for a few minutes, the counter girl informed us that since they had just served a party they were hosting, they had run out of everything, but a few tartines.  I wasn't that bummed because i was going to order one anyways, but if you are out of something, it should not be written on the board.\nMy tartine was excellent, the cheddar was super aged, the addition of the boccocini was masked though by the robust cheddar.  I love how crusty the bread gets when they toast it, but near the end, my sandwich was slightly soggy.  \nThe macarons were better then the last time,  we had cassis, strawberry, and salted caramel.  The buttercream was fruity in the two, and the shells had that great chew.  \nWe ordered a chocolate chip cookie, this thing was massive, and it was on the verge of being burnt, they must bake it at a very high temp, but it was delicious. Now for the downside of the meal, i ordered a chocolate almond croissant, and it tasted more like a bun than a croissant, it was not flaky.  Also, i didn't like the melted choc, and the frangipan, it was too wet.  My sis had the regular croissant and she found the same issues with it as mine, it just wasn't flaky.  \nOverall this still remains one of my go to places for lunch, just next time i would opt for more macarons instead of a croissant.", "business_id": "tnnG9W2K-rOP0i8K1LOCmQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-03-27", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "tZB9gcjFSkw_sYTX4-cmJQ", "review_id": "t8Vlmzs3pTAK9W9RZarZ4w", "text": "Absolutely love it!

I am happy to say that my visit this week was far from that experience.  If anything, the service was overly pleasant and so inviting that I'm tempted to go back next week.  Polite, attentive, and geniuine.  I can't ask for more... they were eager to share and explain all the various goodies on display.  \n\nI went during lunch and was surprised how much was sold out already.  Perhaps they underestimated the morning crowd but at 11:30 am, 2 of the 3 types of quiche were gone.  All the pain au chocolat disappeared and there was not a sight of a macaron anywhere.  Though I was hoping to snag any of the forementioned items, I was still enthralled in trying their tarts, cakes, and plain croissant.  I purchased a tarte au citron, creme brulee tart, opera cake slice, and a plain croissant to satisfy my pastry tooth.\n\nFor croissants, the hallmark of a great croissant comes from two wonderful things.  The first being that wonderful technique of folding over and over again to get that beautiful layered swirl. And secondly, a lovely amount of butter that helps develop a light crispy flakey texture that keeps you wanting to eat more.  Let's be frank... butter = good.  Sabletine's croissant was a bit smaller than I'm used to but I'm ok with portion control on butter.  It looked like it puffed up a decent amount so I was hopeful it'd be good. When sliced through, the cross section showed the lovely layers.  Upon taking a bite, I wasn't disappointed but I wasn't wow'd either.  It wasn't dry or lacking in flavour but it wasn't flakey.  It had a hardened exterior and even harder bottom... perhaps the butter leaked out and it sizzled in the buttery oil while baking?  It reminds me of my earlier attempts at baking croissants.  \n\nThe tarts faired much better.  The pate sucree (sweet pastry crust) was lovely.  The crust  was buttery with a nice texture (not soggy!) and it was a nice foundation for the filling.  Though these weren't large, the size allowed you take many small bites of lucious creamy centres.  The tarte au citron was a good balance between puckered lemons and sweetness.  The creme brulee tarte was a decent and comprised of a smooth custard but it was missing it's signature crackling caramelized sugary top!  \n\nOverall, there are some good pastry and tarte choices that will have me coming back to try.  It's a decent bakery for a city of that normally would not have a French bakery.  I hope next time though they'll actually have some good macarons, quiches, and pain au chocolat so I can hopefully bump up their rating to a 4!", "business_id": "tnnG9W2K-rOP0i8K1LOCmQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-08-29", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "pMvBcuBV9LoF9rOKi0sIgA", "review_id": "78or8U4AcXROJu1yJeUPGQ", "text": "I managed to snag some macarons here finally!  With their new fall flavours, I bought all of them except the pear (I've never had a good pear macaron and at $2 per macaron, I'm not risking another let down).  I bought the pistachio and bing cherry, raspberry, cassis, pumpkin spice, cappuccino, vanilla, and sea salt caramel.  When I first spied them, I was pretty darn happy that I finally got to try them.  Like all things in French bakeries, these were not cheap.  The 6 moderate to mini sized macaron cost over $10.  So was it worth it... ? Not really but it holds pretty good promise.\n\nWith macaron, they're notoriously fussy to make.  They depend on good technique to get that nice crispy meringue like crust while trying to prevent air bubbles in the cookie.  The texture cannot be too gummy (undercooked) but slightly resembles a homemade just freshly made marshmallow (not gummy but soft chew without being cakey).  I'll be upfront and say Sabletine has good technique.  These macaron were well made.  Nice smooth shells so that tells me they grounded the almonds very nicely.  The crust was crispy and shattered perfectly under a bite.  The texture was that nice perfect mild chew without being gummy or cakey.  I was quite happy with this part of the macaron.\n\nAs for flavour and size, this is where it was a bit of a letdown.  Some of these macaron should be labeled as mini macaron (as they do in Bouchon bakery) and not charged full prices.  They're that small!  The flavours were not as good as the Chocolate Alphabet bakery in Oakville (which is the best one I've found so far west of Toronto).  \n\nThe pistachio and bing cherry was good... I really do love the slivers of bing cherry in the filling.  That was very well done!  The pistachio flavour was there but was very mild.  I wish it to be a more pronounced. \n\n The raspberry macaron was just 'sweet' and barely had a berry taste.\n\nThe cassis was wonderful. You really taste the black current and it wasn't overly sweet.\n\nThe sea salt and caramel had a nice flavour ... Personally I found it on bit light since the caramel was in a butter cream filling. The best sea salt caramel I've had was a ganache base.\n\nCappuccino held a surprise! It had an actual coffee bean in it. I wasn't expecting it so I didn't love it... It was an over whelming bitter coffee burst in an otherwise mild coffee flavored macaron. If it was smaller and chocolate covered, that would be great.\n\nThe last macaron I had was pumpkin spice. I really liked this one but they should call it fall spiced or just cinnamon and nutmeg. There was no ginger taste at all. The flavour though did shine through nicely though.\n\nSo about half of the macarons were very good (cassis, 'fall ' spice, and caramel) with the rest being decent. They have really good technique .. I just wish they're more consistent with their sizes and all of their flavours be as good as the cassis or fall spice.", "business_id": "tnnG9W2K-rOP0i8K1LOCmQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-10-13", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "KVC5c01sp-WMQmMbFkqv_g", "review_id": "lt0qhN7e9LFPDZnge-p87Q", "text": "Went here for lunch today-I ordered the chicken souvlaki wrap, sis ordered steak sandwich and hubby ordered smoked meat sandwich.

Seeing how it's all students running about to classes, it makes sense.  This East Side Mario is old when you compare it to other restaurants.  Actually, when you compare the restaurant to the froshes, they're practically the same age.  Closest to UW and in the University plaza, this ESM has stood at the prime location for a long time.  I guess it's feeding the students and it's families when they come for a visit to the campus.  It's old and worn and the service feels the same.  There's a lot of indifference.  \n\nThis particular location gets a lot of traffic.  You'll have families of all ages and a lot of young frosh with their parents here.  With ESM being a very common chain restaurant, finding something you recognize is probably great for parents who travel 4+ hours to visit their kids.  Each time I've been dragged here (tally of 3 so far), we've had to wait even with a reservation.  It drives me nuts.  The worst wait for 20 minutes even with a reservation!  Once we're seated, you can feel the grime on the floor boards.  The menu is the universal heavily sauced, cheese laden, and breaded American Italian.  This place executes quickly on the mediocre dishes.  It's one of the few things this place does well... it moves dishes very fast.  Lasagna, grilled chicken salad, and bread was dropped off at our tables within 10 minutes of ordering.  The food tasted like it was just re-warmed in the oven from being in the freezer.  It's no better than McCain at the local grocery store.  \n\nAs I mentioned, the service is subpar.  Perhaps it's the cheap tipping by students or that it's a really tough job with such a high turn over of tables, but they really don't care.  Refills are requested and forgotten.  Forks are not given.  Servers barely look at you and they mutter instead of speak clearly.  There's not budda boom budda bing to their step.   \n\nThere's a lot of great eating places in Waterloo and this isn't one of them.  If you're a student, venture to any of the other restaurants at the plaza.  The vegetarian and Taiwainese places are good starts.

Hands down, this is the best restaurant to get Thai food in Waterloo.\n\nDecor: The front of the store has many Thai-influenced decorations such as statues of elephants and there is faint music playing in the background to complete the 'Thai' ambiance. There are a few (7/8?) tables in the front which fill up first, and there is a back section to the restaurant which opens up a lot more tables during those busy hours. This restaurant is a great place to bring a date (get a 2-person table by the window and watch locals stroll down King street), host a birthday party (tables accommodating large crowds in the back), or just have casual lunch or dinner with some friends!\n\nFood: AMAZING! My favourite dishes are the Pad Thai and the Emerald Curry with Shrimp. The Pad Thai is made perfectly. It is not too dry, not too spicy and has the right amount of meat and veggies to perfectly complement the dish. The Emerald Curry is their most popular curry dish, I believe, and for good reason -- it is incredibly tasty! For appetizers, I like the calamari. If you're not sure what to get, they have an appetizers sampler dish! Also, they have vegetarian and gluten-free options for those with stricter diets.\n\nPrice: For the quality of the food, I'd say everything is fair-priced. They have some great lunch specials that include rice (normal entree dishes do not come with rice!) for about $10. Overall, you can get a delicious and filling meal for around $15 per person for dinner, and $10 per person for lunch. Students: if you have that coupon booklet for students, they have a 13% off coupon in there! Awesome value.\n\nOverall, I have no complaints about this place!

Seats and tables everywhere and well spaced out to boot!\n\nWhile some previous reviews made mention of a \"tacky\" decor, I would have to strongly disagree and even argue that I feel they were just looking for something wrong. I think the correct word to describe this would be simple, elegant with tasteful splashes of Thai cultural items (Buddha's, gold statues, drapery, pottery). It wasn't in my face and looked fine to me.\n\nEnough about the trivial and unimportant though, lets take a look at the key fixture here, the food! To begin, one of my friends and I decided to share the Mango Salad. This dish has recently become a personal fav of mine when dining Thai as the marriage of sweet/spicy chili sauce, mixed with the saltiness of the peanuts and the sweet flavour of the mangoes is the best way to start \"MY THAI\" experience! My onyl critique would be that the mangoes were a touch under ripe, but not to the point where it hurt the dish - I just like my mangoes a little softer :)\n\nNext up I requested and order of their Coconut shrimp for the table to share. Only one word describes this dish - AMAZING. Huge portion of 6 X-large shrimp. I've never come across value like this. Served hot and with a side of sweet chili sauce - Excellent - Highly Recommend!\n\nFinally, as I bordered the fine line between hungry and gluttonous, I ordered my main course. The emerald curry with chicken, which I requested be made extra spicy. The veggies and chicken were cooked beautifully and served in ample curry sauce. Poured over my white rice I was full in minutes but decided - waste not want not and polished the bowl clean.\n\nAll the while enjoying my food I partook and in house cocktail special to this locationI had their Thai One On cocktail.

No kick to it at all but I admit it had plenty of beef in it, and some undercooked boiled potatoes.  The coconut shrimp were very dark brown and tasted burnt.  They were also sweet and the dipping sauces for both the spring rolls and shrimp were cloyingly sweet even after we squeezed lime juice in and added chili paste.  Not the tangy spicy sauces we expect.  They serve western cutlery and we had to request chop sticks.  These were cheap takeout disposables. These are dishes made for north American taste buds - Frankly there is nothing authentic about this food.  We were feeling ill with all the sweet, cloyingly sweet - well, everything!

There was nowhere to sit with friends just to hang around, to see and be seen by every other teenager in town. On summer nights in 1995 and earlier, we resorted to drinking Slurpees at the park. There were just no other options.\n\nThen Williams appeared with its fancy coffee drinks, its big, shareable slices of cake and its 24 hour opening time. It was just what the Waterloo kids needed!\n\nThe hours are now reduced to 6:30am to 1am, sadly. However, Williams is still busy busy busy all the time. The drinks and food are mostly ordinary stuff, but this remains a default spot to meet friends for a chat or for students to taking refuge from the university libraries. Most of the booths are occupied by one person who has taken over the space with textbooks and laptop paraphernalia. My retired mother likes to meets her other retired lady friend here for a cappuccino, although she does complain that the place can be a little bit noisy for her taste. This is the heart of student land, so that's not surprising.\n\nAlso, there is free wifi at this Williams location. Tangent: when I first started hanging out here, the Internet was only available via dial-up at the school library and we needed parental permission in order to purchase a school board-approved e-mail account.", "business_id": "SsV9YH7aPh7PePHNjLg62Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-06-20", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "co98KsHU08o0wQumBALaEw", "review_id": "iq6vvnGtr6uTAbSMFKrD1A", "text": "One of my favourite hangouts near UW campus.

I recently tried their new \"Picks\" menu, where you get half of any sandwich and/or panini, a side salad or soup and a dessert (cookie, apple or kettle chips). My favourite combination for picks is: pesto chicken panini, strawberry fields salad w/ feta (or something like that -- this is DELICIOUS!) and kettle chips. It's a bit pricy -- around $8-$9 for the combo, but really you're paying for the atmosphere (casual sit-down restaurant).

You walk in, order your food and choose your own table so there is no real wait staff, just bussers who come around clearing and cleaning tables. You pay for your food when you order at the counter so no one will ever subtly ask you to leave by giving you your cheque\n\nLastly, not sure why this establishment is labelled \"nightlife\".

There are also little adorable button bouquets on all the tables, a mishmash of whitewashed chairs at the tables and water is served in vintage glasses with cool old images on them--all of which add up to a really appealing, groovy vibe (they were playing Medeski, Martin & Wood when we came in--another point in their favour and good addition to the feel).\n\nOn this occasion, we came by here because we had Groupons--but we will most definitely be back. The meal included paninis, a side and a coffee. My decaf was delicious, as was my California Veggie panini, along with a walnut side with balsamic dressing. My companion had an Italian panini with a pasta salad (pasta, olives, feta). He also passed on the coffee and instead purchased their dessert hot chocolate, which is thick and super rich--check out the photos of the spoon standing upright in it--more like warm, thick chocolate pudding in a cup than drinking chocolate, really.\n\nIn all, a really nice place to hang out--and of course, the movie theatre and magic store (complete with the sign \"children left unattended will be sold to the circus\") all add to the overall feel.\n\nBTW, sorry for the dim images--we came at night and our table was in one of the less brightly lit portions of the cafe. Hopefully you can make out the spoon standing in the hot chocolate, and the panini and salad (with cloth napkins and vintage glasses).", "business_id": "jmCTyc_KgUsHpdZKBBTklQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-12", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "qrTcshwswH_D3OdcLKHnnw", "review_id": "IV9kaosBpw4Rtz1YeuaGqg", "text": "Bacon jam.

Wish the burger held together a bit better and a bit pricey for the student part of town (since when could students afford a $12 for a burger combo?!) but all in all, one of the better burgers in Waterloo.\n\nThe long review:\nThis burger and bar joint opened up earlier in 2011, and I'm surprised that it hasn't been reviewed given the number of students who frequent it. The concept of Frat Burger is fresh ground beef with patties made daily, fresh cut fries, fresh fresh fresh is the key, and from what I can tell, they're doing a pretty good job of it, and students are loving it.\n\nIt's not your typical student type atmosphere (which is to say, a complete dive) and when you walk in you actually feel like you're in a decent establishment, with prices to match. I'm not sure when students were able to afford $12 meals (if you're eating in, with tip you're looking at $15), I know I certainly couldn't nowadays. And silly me, here I thought the world economy was in the gutters. But the prices are what one's used to if you're looking for a decent quality burger in Toronto, and McD's is like $8 for a combo nowadays, so relatively, I guess it's not too bad.\n\nThe burger:\nThe have several options, with your regular/classic with lettuce and tomatoes starting at $5, and speciality burgers adding a bit to that. I had the California something or other, which was the burger of the day for $6, and it came with guac, salsa and texmex cheese (noteably, NO tomatoes and lettuce, much to my dismay).  They say you can ask for the burger pink, right on the menu, which is nice, and I did so, 'cause there's nothing worse than an overdone burger.  Burger came out, it was fresh, pink to order, and pretty darn good.  My only complaints, to be nit picky, is the bun could actually be a bit bigger, because I ran into burger spillage (when the burger comes out the backside of the bun) and the burger didn't hold together that well.  Whether that's the recipe, or because it was cooked pink, or because the bun was a tad too small, I'm not sure, but parts of my burger were falling apart, so I needed a fork to pick it up. Another important point, it's cooked on a flattop, which I prefer, so it had that nice crust I love and crave on my burgers. Final verdict: good burger, I think my favorite burger in Waterloo now. I'll be back next time I'm here for work!\n\nFries:\nIf you order fries with your burger, it's $2, sans burger, $3.  Claiming they are fresh cut and double fried, I expect greatness, and for the most part, they're pretty good. A bit softer than I tend to like, I love crisp fries like the ones found @ Stockyards in TO, but that's just personal preference. Again, probably some of the better fries in Waterloo.

Their burgers are fantastic with a diverse selection of meats and veggie options for the patty, I recommend the lamb. Toppings are limited unless you're willing to pay extra for premium toppings but that's to be expected.

I often end up getting extra on the side because I love it that much.\n\nAs for the location itself it really try's to play up the 'frat' theme even though sometimes I'm not sure they even know what that means. Frat Burger is also conveniently located right across from Wilfrid Laurier University so it's just a hop, skip and jump from campus for students. The interior of this place looks like it's something out of animal house or something similar I suppose which I dig. There is a large dining area inside as well as a large bar. They serve booze here and I believe Thursday nights they have a great burger and PBR deal for $10. \n\nNow on to what I don't like. Unfortunately the burgers, although very delicious, are TINY and often leave you wanting more.

One of my favorite parts of dining here though is the wait staff - they've always been incredibly friendly and accommodating. \n\nThe food is above-average. I have enjoyed everything I've tried here. Some highlights are the cedar-plank brie, the Thai Noodles, and the Jacob's Mac and Cheese. The Black and Blue burger was also delicious, if you're looking for a red meat fix! And the crispy potato wedges are seriously some of the best I've ever had (and I'm kind of a snob about good 'fries' of any kind).\n\nI'd highly recommend dining here if you're looking for a relaxed, but great, dinner or in the St. Jacobs area.", "business_id": "9ISzUw1zs9sXrcxg9nafkg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-03-25", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "2T8STHAUqQuWxkqu195hAw", "review_id": "Ef3FzOd5ox1pJ_1if5HYxg", "text": "Decided to try it out after reading all the great reviews here.

I like the village of St. Jacobs and this restaurant is nice but not spectacular. I find the service a bit inconsistent as well as the food. The last time I was in I ordered the fish & chips. Aside from that I found it unmemorable. I certainly have no need to try the fish and chips again.\n\nOn my most recent visit, I ordered the croque monsieur. For anyone that has had a CM they know that this is a special cheese sandwich and unique in the world of sandwiches. They also know that the outside of the cheese sandwich contains fried cheese and that it crunches. \n\nThe menu here describes the CM as containing ham (this is normal) and some dijon mustard/mayo combination that the menu brags about (this is sort of unusual). No mention of emmenthal or gruyere cheese. No mention of bechamel sauce. These should have been my clues that things were off. But greed overrode reason and here I am.\n\nWhen I received the offering, I noted immediately that this was not a croque monsieur. In fact, it is so far removed from a CM, that the French should rise up and sue this place. My CM was white bread toasted in a waffle panini press with some unknown cheese, a few slices of ham and the dijon/mayo spread. There was no cheese on the outside and the sandwich itself was very small. This came with a side of potato wedges which are not worth commenting on.\n\nAs I was out with friends, I did not bring this to the waitresses attention for several reasons, namely if the chef doesn't know what the hell a CM is, I did not wish to further delude myself into believing someone at Jacob's Grill knew what a CM was.\n\nIn short, if you have $11.99 and are looking for a nice sandwich, I would suggest going to Vincenzo's in Waterloo on Wednesdays and having one of their home run grill cheese sandwiches for $4. You can spend the remaining $8 on a nice piece of cheese from France.\n\nJacob's Grill, you should be ashamed.", "business_id": "9ISzUw1zs9sXrcxg9nafkg", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-09-08", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "wyhmWbZv5bF2I5Oac4hTwg", "review_id": "gcH7TaHROkKfB00PV0j7Hw", "text": "We visit St Jacobs for outlet shopping and the Farmers market and shops once or twice a year.

I haven't been to a lot of bbq joints, the but ones I have, don't normally try to do cajun and bbq.  The chunks of chicken and sausage in the jumbo were very good, but the broth base was terrible.  Plus, when the description on the menu brags about the house made andouille sausage and there's only one piece in the gumbo, you get a little disappointed.\n\nFor dinner, I tried a bbq sampler with their ribs and pulled pork with a side of jalapeno hushpuppies and coleslaw.  The ribs were the toughest ribs I've ever had.  I had to bite and rip and chew.   Honestly, the worst ribs I've had in a restaurant.\n\nThe pulled pork meat was decent, but again was relatively tough as far as pulled pork goes.  Very little smoke flavouring too.

The coleslaw wasn't very creamy, it was a sad pile of wilted cabbage with a smattering of red pepper on it, the fries were decent though.  I can easily take down a plate of ribs but I just didnt want to, I must've left half the rack on the plate, I didn't want them for take out either.

LA fitness is and athletic club located on Victoria Street which can pressure you into buying services that are not necessary. I got a tour of the facility and was overly impressed but after trying a few hours later I was very disappointed with the environmental feel of the club. I spoke with the person that was helping me earlier and asked if I can cancel my membership because I am not enjoying the feeling of this club. He said \"that it'll take time to get used to and just tried for two months and let us know how you feel about it.\" I told the gentleman that I am quite confident that I would like to cancel my membership and if you could please do so and refund me of my payment. The employees said that he was unable to cancel a contract because you have to be within the contract under the time specified; which was two months.\n\nI left with frustration and disappointment. When I returned home I read over the contract and the second paragraph it said, that I am able to cancel the contract after ten days of receiving the paper contract, and they would need to refund me of the full amount within 15 days after a cancellation. I returned to LA fitness and presented the employee with the document and requested to refund my money. He was unable to do this because the operation manager was not working at the time, which is fine with me. But in the end I felt like I was being jerked around, pressured in keeping my membership and felt like they were on commission. Would never recommend this athletic club to anyone.\n\nJANUARY:\nEven though I canceled my membership with LA fitness, they have just put gasoline on the fire today. I have received a cold call from LA fitness asking if I'm still interested in using my complementary personal training session. For a second I was thinking that my current gym is calling me 'GoodLife' but it's so happens to be the obnoxious trainer from LA fitness who was extremely displeased that I canceled my membership after 48 hours of having a membership with them. Here is one more reason why LA fitness is a terrible company. In addition to my bad experience, it's also shows how bad a company is if they don't embrace fearless feedback from their customers. I was unable to find any resources on their main website to be able to voice any complaints or to speak to any customer service representative.

I just use my iPad, so it doesn't matter to me.\n\nAs with any gym, I'd suggest trying the classes to see if they're the right pace for you. I'm not fond of the classes at LA, but that doesn't mean they aren't right for you - heck, there are very few fitness classes anywhere that I like.\n\nThe men's changeroom (and I assume the women's too) has a spa area with a steam room and a whirlpool. When I first joined, I thought I'd use the whirlpool all of the time, but I'm no longer fond of it and it's broken about 1/4 of the time anyway. The steam room is really nice, but I've always been a fan of sauna.\n\nI'm not fond of the personal trainers, but then I'm not fond of personal trainers in general. The crowd at LA fitness tends to be a little on the older side and a little bit more blue-collar than at Goodlife.\n\nOne nice part: they take payment by credit card. Makes it super easy if you need to cancel. Also: they are about middle of the road for pricing. Cheaper than GoodLife, more expensive than World's.\n\nThe Good:\n* Lots of free weights\n* Lots of resistance machines\n* Lots of cardio equipment, if a little bit older\n* Spa in the changeroom\n\nThe Middling:\n* Price (reasonably cheap, good value for what it is)\n* Classes (depends on what you're looking for)\n\nThe Bad:\n* Shared TV's with FM audio\n* Can't recommend their trainers", "business_id": "u3xWH3vsjoLdnUfqwHKVfQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-02-07", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "c-O4murezMutBXLsKpcDPA", "review_id": "UVbKpydHXeQqVsaD19JNGA", "text": "The pizza was good but the wait time for a walk in special was pretty long.

Her explanation was that it was an extra cost for them, which is a cop out considering the addition of a flavour shot made the drink jump for $4.30 to $5.60, you can buy an entire bottle of syrup for less than $10 retail.  I understand that it is a business and they need to make money, but unless you are making your syrups in house, you have no right to charge that much.

So here I write, as a new loyal customer.\n\nTLDR: Exquisite, yet bold and complicated. The ambiance of the cafe sparked my desire to revisit with a book, a pen and a notebook. With a cup of loose leaf tea (and maybe dessert), it's the right place to relax, chat and get inspired.\n\nThe moment I stepped into the cafe, I was mesmerized by its interior. The coffeehouse reminded me of a rustic yet modern British cafe in the movies. The old brick walls had lost some of its original colour but maintained its picturesque look. I can tell the owner wanted to construct an atmosphere that was casual enough for everyday conversations without losing the potential to become a semi-formal place for business. And that was exactly what the coffeehouse is: a blend of sophisticated students and professionals.\n\nDVLB is different than your ordinary coffeehouses. Why? Well, it serves whisky. Single-malt whisky, \"the true pinnacle of all whisky goodness.\"\n\nDidn't expect that, did ya?\n\nTo top it off, DVLB offers a whisky map for your tasting journey. For those interested, they carry a wide selection from light to rich, delicate to smoky, from around Scotland, Japan, Canada, Australia, India and more. Sadly, I've yet to become a whisky drinker, but if you've ventured and tried their whiskies, let me know how they turned out!\n\nOne random and weird rule I follow when trying new cafes is only order the coffee when the tea is not just tea. That is, the tea brings deep thoughts into your consciousness, or a blissful smile on your face.\n\nChai tea is like the standard for reviewing a coffeehouse. It's the most basic spiced tea that every cafe carries. My eyes widened when I first took a sip of the tea; it wasn't sweet at all! Instead, the foamy milk brought out the fragrance of the spices without the sweetness getting in the way. As a frequent customer of chain cafes like Williams, Second Cup and Starbucks, the fact that the tea was unsweetened certainly left quite an impression. Of course, DVLB provides you with sugars and other additions, but they weren't necessary.\n\nThe tea reminded me of the Doctor. \"Good cup of tea!

That being said, we are often more critical because we have seen some of the best and some of the worst. Either way, it has been fun!\n\n\nWow! We were walking down King st with no destination for dinner other than check out the local cute restaurants. We went into King street Trio to check out the menu and could have not been more welcomed by Andrew.  Holidays (in this case Family Day) often are slow in higher end restaurants. We have found in our travels across America  and Canada for business that  for whatever reason these restaurants hosts take out the slow day on walk-in traffic making you wish you never walked in because you did not have a reservation or know the secret handshake.\n\nNot here! Andrew asked us if we had a reservation, when we replied in the negative he immediately went into action telling us to pick any table we liked. He didn't just sit us and take off, he spent a few minutes acquainting us with the menu and drink menu.\n\nOur server Ashley was really great. Again, sometimes on a slow night you will get a server that mentally takes the night off and you constantly have to wave them down or they are practically sitting on the table because they are bored. Ashley was neither, she was on top of her game. \n\nAndrew came to our table to see how we were doing and we mentioned how much we liked the decor and the menu he showed us a recent favorable review (which raved about my meal & I concur). He was incredibly informative about the other restaurants within the umbrella of Trio, and explained the differences in menus to us.\n\nMy chicka is an odd gal, she is crazy friendly and chatty. Though show her a dirty restaurant bathroom & she wants us to pay for drinks and move on. She is a big believer in details, and if a restaurant cannot be bothered to keep a bathroom reasonably clean or soap filled... we are gone. Trio... was immaculate. \n\nI  had the Porcini Chicken Supreme. It was incredible. The Chicken was well cooked and tender but not over cooked by being stuffed. The stuffing of cheese and mushrooms was just enough yet not overwhelming or lacking.\n\nMy Chicka had the Pickeral which as Ashley described was a stronger tasting Tilapia. It was incredible! My chicka wondered why this native of the great lake's is not used more. A Google search turned up that this fish has smaller bones which can lead to trouble deboning. This just adds to our love for Trio, they take the time work with difficult fish for excellent results.\n\nAs we enjoyed the atmosphere &  finished our wine Andrew informed us that being travelers dessert was on the house. WoW!!!!!!!!!!!! Please order the desserts, their dessert chef is amazing!!!!!!!!!! To make it even more incredible, Ashley brought out some candied Almonds. Little did Ashley know that my Chicka packs a snack bag of mixed nuts for me to snack on... my chicka was not shy to let her know & laugh at how Ashley was now my new nut supply.\n\n\nSo we were finishing up and signing the check, Ashley brought out more candied Almonds because I must of had huge eyes and my Chicka made fun of my love of nuts. Seriously.... how nice!!\n\nBetween Andrew and Ashley we wish that the owners open up a Trio  in Chicago's River North so we can have an awesome restaurant that is i walking distance.", "business_id": "krdgHbil2McRJPB_WQ5fHQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-02-25", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "n5XeEBok4MtLe9VbPlFd2w", "review_id": "HfzXm7eprYP62WNfnrDbSw", "text": "The new location is elegant and pleasing to look at, but I found the menu to be rather pedestrian, and the execution to be equally uninspiring.

A request for rare meat came out as medium. The pasta was too saucy and under spiced with chicken that could have used better marination.\n\nWine selection was also drab, though we did manage to find a fairly good Pinot from Rodney Strong Estates in California. We asked for a decanter and received \"nicer\" glasses as well. I found that odd, as if unless you ask, you don't get the quality glassware! Note on the wine: it definitely opens up nicely.\n\nThe service was average yet friendly. We were at one point told that we may need to vacate our table prior to the second seating, and I found that to be unnecessary.

It really does.  I've been to the two previous incarnations of this restaurant (when it was Downtown in Kitchener and when it was on University in Waterloo) and although I was excited to come for dinner with my wife to celebrate our Wedding Anniversary, I have to say in the end I was a bit disappointed... because the details matter.\n\nWe were the first customers in the restaurant for the evening for dinner.  We had made our reservations on OpenTable and we made a change from Saturday to Friday night due to a change in my family's plans.  The change was easily made on my iPhone app and we had no issues with the reservations.\n\nThe restaurant, however, was quite cold when we arrived (although it did get warmer as the evening went on and there were more customers), and the window seat the the coldest of all.  We really liked the idea of a window seat so that we could look across at the skating in the public square, but in the end, the seats closest to the window were just too cold.  After that, it took some time to get service.  Our server seemed distracted, even though for the nearly the first half hour we were there, the restaurant was completely empty of customers besides ourselves.\n\nThe food was great.  For starers, we ordered the Seared Sea Scallops to share and my wife had a salad while I had the chicken chowder.  All the appetizers came at once.  For our mains, my wife ordered the Chicken Alfredo and I ordered the Earth and Ocean.  I got my dish, and my wife had the wrong order.  No apology was given, just a \"that doesn't look like the Alfredo\" and it was scurried away.  After waiting for a few awkward minutes, I eventually started my meal first (my wife insisted, since it was cold in the restaurant and she didn't want my food to get cold).  I was mostly done my entree by the time the Alfredo appeared.  Again, no apology for the mix-up, and the server was off again.  We did split a Chocolate Mousse Cake for dessert, and it was delicious.\n\nHowever, I take this time to note that I was more impressed at the dishes I received at the King Crab Oyster Bar and Grill (sister restaurant to King Street Trio).  To be fair, if I was to give King Crab 5 stars, then King Street Trio would only get four stars.  I thought that the food, although it was great, it did not taste as good as the food at the sister restaurant.  Again, the small details make the difference.\n\nThe restaurant is beautiful, a century-old building that has been spectacularly renovated.  And it is a shame because I think it could be a 5-star place, if there was only a bit more attention to the details.", "business_id": "krdgHbil2McRJPB_WQ5fHQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-12-31", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "NPDgU7eT-MAAbmt4rr_qBw", "review_id": "1kaX95Jjvu6TTUCSYiIgAA", "text": "Ack!

The staff were very accommodating and didn't pressure us to order since we were waiting a little longer in case the others showed up.\n\nI must say there were not many vegetarian options on the dinner menu, which I expected, given it's a steakhouse. Thankfully, their one vegetarian entree was Red Beet Risotto, served with wilted baby spinach and manchego cheese. I was fairly keen on trying this and I wasn't disappointed. Everything in the dish went so well together.\n\nOne funny remark was that since it was snowy outside, immediately when we walled in the door, the manager came up to us and politely told us to try *really hard\" to dry our feet on the mat. He was very concerned about people slipping on wet floors. He did this with every other guest who came in as well.\n\nThe same man also reassured us when it seemed as if a tiny earthquake was happening, \"don't worry it's only the train.\"\n\nOverall I was very happy with this restaurant and would gladly come here again with my carnivorous friends.", "business_id": "krdgHbil2McRJPB_WQ5fHQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-01-30", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "yifMSBYTVG9QxXkAhSpKQQ", "review_id": "UDYBEdwxHR1XnHsYiErDvg", "text": "First, off, I went on a Sunday night and the place was completely deserted.

Since we had already had lunch and it was around 4 pm we ordered the Galao coffee.  I had a strawberry cheesecake (NOT made here - bought in) and my partner had the coconut tart (actually more like a muffin or cupcake).  The Galao is nothing special.  It's a simple Latte - on a par with MacDonald's or Williams Coffee Pub but twice the price.  My cheesecake was overwhelmingly sweet to the point where I couldn't eat it.  The coconut pastry was heavy as lead, dense, and had little to no flavour even though there was plenty of coconut in it.  Two desserts, 2 coffees $14. and change.  The server was a wonderful young man who took alot of time explaining the desserts.  Yes he got a nice tip even though the food was so-so.  The noise was horrendous as they were showing the World Soccer matches on every tv (there are several) and the crowd was drinking and watching the show. The restaurant is clean and new, not classy - very casual, kind of diner style.  We found the menu prices to be very high and were glad we had already eaten.  A side of vegetables or potatoes for example 6.99 and sandwiches around 10.95.  Definitely Toronto pricing here and not what I expect in a plain neighbourhood setting with paper napkins and a large take out counter.  We didn't try the chicken so we can't comment on that or the other mains, but since the prices are steep, I doubt we will be driving there again as there are so many other options.  Really I kind of doubt this place can survive with these prices and that atmosphere.  The breads are brought in from Toronto, ditto the desserts - the only thing made on the premises in baked goods is the Pastel de Nata which was sold out, and we've had plenty of egg tarts before now.  The chicken was still turning on the grill at 4.pm.  Everything is overpriced unless you order from the take out menu.

We got cesar salad, french fries and vegetables which all turned out pretty good. The french fries were perfect actually :D crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.

The servers will ask if you want the beef (or whatever meat you choose if any) well done or \"with a little bit of pink in it\", so it shows they do care about how you want the patty to be done. If you're confused about the menu the servers do an excellent job in assisting you.\n\nThe wait for the burger was about 15-20 minutes, so we ordered some onion rings beforehand...they were HUGE! Comes with two sauces, in which we picked smoked BBQ and sweet/sour. The sweet/sour was better than the BBQ sauce IMO, it was too old fashioned for my liking.\n\nThe burger itself...the ingredients were good...but the beef itself lacked taste. Maybe it's the reason why the server warned beforehand if I wanted well done or \"a little bit of pink in it\".\n\nConsidering our total bill came to $45 (even after a $2 deduction as my dad didn't take a side), I didn't feel I got exactly that I expected.

We risked not reserving, but thankfully not many people knew this place opens on Victoria Day.\n\nI went for the dining table, since I can experience teppanyaki with one of the chefs I know back in Toronto. We were welcomed by a very attentive greeter and an even more attentive waiter who served us the entire time we were there.\n\nI was expecting the large amounts of variety in the rolls, and the menu didn't disappoint me. I went with the White Christmas Roll, Volcano Roll, and Dake Crunch Roll.\n\nThe White Christmas Roll is good in the sense it's not as filling as some of the other rolls (see Volcano Roll), yet it's still tasty all in itself. There is no seaweed in this roll, which is kinda interesting...never had a roll without seaweed in my life. The Volcano Roll is very good, I really liked the sauce they used, very filling, and the scallops and eels were cooked perfectly...albeit slightly too mushy. Finally, the Dake Crunch Roll was my favourite, with the crunchy bits tasting like wasabi, but not to the point of spiciness (I normally can't stand wasabi in my food), plus the other ingredients tasting very good as well.\n\nAside from the slight mushiness from the Volcano Roll, I was also slightly irritated by the screaming folks down by the teppanyaki table. I understand this restaurant is the only place with teppanyaki and some residents may be enjoying for the first time, but the restaurant is such an open concept that I can hear the chatter even from across the restaurant (and the restaurant is quite big)...so please, keep it down over there.\n\nWill recommend to my friends, will come back for sure.", "business_id": "0IHFyelJXAkNyS7tx2tRvw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-05-20", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "aeao6NPNZzZeozAFPgWTGg", "review_id": "HEU5FcdKCCm5Z1-GyATizw", "text": "I was visited Dake on a Friday evening at 5:30 for teppanyaki.  It was not the great experience I was hoping for.\n\nPositives:\nThe restaurant is trendy and nicely decorated.  They really did a great job overhauling the old Zeke's Feed and Fuel.  Service was friendly.  The table side cooking was interesting and entertaining.\n\nNegatives:\nOur teppanyaki grill just had one other couple when we arrived but they squished us in beside them instead of spreading us out a bit.  I felt crowded during the meal and it was awkward having a private conversation with my husband during our meal.\n\nThe chef first cooked the vegetables.  When they were ready, instead of dividing them up into four equal portions and serving them to the four of us, he gave the men larger portions than the ladies.  Although my hubby does eat more than me, shouldn't it be up to me if I give him the portion of my meal I can't eat and not the chef?  Also instead of putting the cooked veggies aside on a cooler part of the grill,  cooking the meat, then serving everything together, he served the veggies right away. We then had to decide whether to eat a plate full of hot veggies on their own while the meat was cooking, or wait while the meat was cooking and eat cold veggies when it was served.  The veggies, although nicely cooked, were very bland.\n\nI ordered shrimp for @25.95 and my hubby ordered shrimp and calamari for $27.95.\nThey brought out two servings of shrimp, one serving of calamari,  two chicken breasts and a steak.   I received about 10 shrimp, my hubby got 4 and the other gentleman got 6 with his steak.  The volume of shrimp and calamari in my hubby's meal was much less than the volume of shrimp I got and his meal was $2 more.  Calamari on it's own is the cheapest thing on the menu!  The other lady who ordered chicken (the second cheapest thing on the menu) received two full chicken breasts to eat.  She even exclaimed as it was being piled on her plate \"That's all for me?!?\"  It just didn't make sense.  Not to mention the shrimp was overcooked.\n\nThe meal overall was not very flavourful.  Thankfully, two sauces were provided: ginger and something wasabi-flavoured.  These were served in a dish with two sides.  My hubby, who can't stand wasabi, could not pour the ginger sauce on his plain steamed rice without getting wasabi in it.  \n\nWhen we were finished eating, we were left sitting with our dirty dishes in front of us for 10 minutes, still crowded at the teppanyaki table.  It wasn't until we both stood up that the waitress came over to see if we wanted anything else.  And the restaurant was not busy in the least.  \n\nOverall:\nThis restaurant has received great reviews, but it sounds like most people have eaten the sushi.  In my opinion, we had over-priced, under-portioned, bland stir-fry and a mediocre dining experience.  I had teppanyaki once before in Cuba and it was a wonderful experience but at Dake, I couldn't wait to get out of there.  The Mongolian Grill offers far more selection and flavour with a similar experience for a much better price.", "business_id": "0IHFyelJXAkNyS7tx2tRvw", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-08-03", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "eEQ9oMloFGCVzEpuDBNd0g", "review_id": "jWbyG1kuDuq9GDAIu3TqUw", "text": "Friends and I went out for lunch.

The service really brings it down to  a three. \n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant is fine - it's a bit strange because the decorations are obviously Greek, which we got a kick out of. But no big deal - what matters is the food! \n\nThe service was quite slow - although we were asked about drinks shortly after sitting down, our server returned more than ten minutes later without the drinks to take our orders and then brought them out rather slowly and one at a time. When I asked about what to order if I'd never had Salvadoran food before our server helpfully suggested a few sampler dinners and what each one includes, but when I started asking about food off the sampler platter he couldn't explain what the food was or what it tastes like because he'd never had it. He also suggested the fajitas, but we didn't opt for them because he couldn't tell us whether they were the same as regular fajitas (which we can get most places). \n\nOn to the food: There are two sampler platters - one with set items (pork and cheese pupusas, beef and vegetable pastelito, choice of beef or chicken enchilada, and chicken tamales) and another that lets you choose any combo of four pupusas, pastelitos, enchiladas, tamales, and tacos. Since a few people got the set platter I decided to try a few different items and got the customizable one, which I think was more than worth the extra dollar! I had the pork, beans, cheese, and loroco (loroco is apparently a type of flower - the server didn't know what they were and had never tried them, so I Googled it!) pupusa and it was my favourite item. I also strongly prefered the sweet corn tamale to the chicken one - but that's just me! The meal came with salsa (mild, medium, or hot) and a side of vinegar coleslaw that tasted almost pickled. \n\nOne more word on the food: The enchiladas - they are NOT like Mexican enchiladas! They are more like a giant, extreme nacho. They are really tasty, but you will be surprised if you're expecting a Mexican enchilada. (Nicaraguan enchiladas are also different - they're more like an empanada... must be a thing with enchiladas). \n\nI would have liked to try dessert but by the time we were asked about it we'd been at the restaurant for two hours and were worried about getting a ticket for street parking (maxes out at two hours). \n\nYou could eat here for under $10, but the platter with drinks put our bill for two people up to $35, so I'm putting it in the $$ category.", "business_id": "FZaS-3nwO_PJs7xHBAio8Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-09-27", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}, "user_id": "TSTNcYCqJRjV184y8fqZ9g", "review_id": "Dna1h1mKxIQaobdQyUJYYQ", "text": "Delicious! \nWe stopped in here later on a Friday evening and the service wad fast and friendly.

First it's salty and there's the squeaky cheese curds, then you get the smokiness from the bacon, then again you get a hit of sweetness from the caramelized onions.

The Bulgolgi came quickly, and it was delicious, but the Pork Bone Soup was lost in translation somewhere in the kitchen.  But this is where the service (which is fast and efficient, with knowledgeable English-speaking and Korean-speaking servers) shines.  As Don Cherry would say \"Now all you kids out there, listen up\" - this is why this place gets five stars: When the server was told that the Pork Bone Soup was missing, she quickly got a new order out to our table, and she apologized profusely, then told us that the item was on the house!  The soup was served piping hot and was even better than I remembered...  There was a lot of pork on the pork bones and the soup was spicy and rich, with a big piece of flavour-packed potato.  The great food gets you, as a customer coming in, but it is the excellent service that keeps you coming back.\n\nThe Famous Owl of Minerva Korean Restaurant & Bar is the newest branch of the chain that started in Toronto, and it has been voted the best...

But I have heard many good things about the Owl.\n\nAs I was saying, I was extremely happy because I didn't need to go to any of the Korean restaurants at the University plaza. I can finally get some authentic, tasty, filling Korean food that I was craving. \n\nIt is located very conveniently near Uptown Waterloo, which is short iXpress or 7 bus ride from the University. \n\nThe d\u00e9cor is average..lots of wood and high ceilings that makes it feel empty. There are no service bells that are typically found in Korean restaurants but that is okay because the service is very attentive that you don't need bells to get their attention. I must say, out of all the Korean restaurants that I have been to, this place has the best service. They actually checked up on us, twice in one sitting. Which was nice and somewhat surprising. I was used to the neglectful service at Nak Won. The servers are very friendly with welcoming smiles. \n\nLet's get on with the food. Love the pork bone soup :D very, very good and will leave you filled and satisfied. The price is $7.99. However, I think there is MSG in it because I was extremely thirsty after finishing the pork bone soup and some time after that. The bibimbap ($9.99), however, was not as spectacular. In fact, I found it quite bland but it came with miso soup :) . I will just wait to go back to Toronto to get my bibimbap\n\nOh, and they don't used metal chopsticks that I normally see at Korean restaurants.

Fun Fact: did you know Kitchener has the largest Oktoberfest celebration outside of Germany in the entire world? True story!\n\nThis place was visibly an older Best Western that had merely given itself a minor refresh in the main lobbies and the guest rooms. While I didn't really see much of a difference in the hotel itself I felt that the little touches in the guest rooms were done quite well.\n\nThe beds were extremely comfortable, adorned with 4 of the most amazing pillows (very close to those I've used at various 4-5 star hotels in Toronto and in other major cities). I slept like a little drunkin baby (if babies got drunk that is). Best of all was the fact that the rooms/bathrooms were clean and smoke free. \n\nCouple of crummy spots about this place were for one that the parking is a tad wonky as you need to circle the building to get to parking on the left side of the building, a tad inconvenient. Also I found that although they had put so much effort into remodeling parts of this hotel and put a large effort into making it smoke free environment, the former stench of cigarette smoke was deeply embedded into the hallways and carpets. Very unpleasant every time you walk out of your room. \n\nYour stay does include a complimentary breakfast, which was for all intents and purposes is a glorified Continental breakfast. Boiled eggs and costco style shrivled sausages were the differentiators. The one nice thing was the DIY Waffle station which is what made the breakfast worth while. Would have been happy to go elsewhere for breakfast but this was OK. Manage your expectations. \n\nNot bad at all - thank goodness the beds were so amazing. However I don't feel this place was worth the $140+ for the night. Little bit aggressive for a 2-2.5 trip advisor  rated place. My star rating falls inline with that.... strong 2.5 but well round it to a 3.\n\nWould I return? In a pinch sure - if there weren't nicer options in a comparable price range.

The first time I was coming, I found out they were not going to be open for lunch for the time being.  The next time I came I was told they were out of Congee!  The following day I came, and the place was closed due to the plaza cutting the power to the building.  I am sympathetic to the new business, and I am not easy deterred.  I was going to \"get my Congee on\" - and I wouldn't stop until I did.  I made my plans and tried again...\n\nFor the uninitiated...  what is Congee?  Congee is a Chinese rice porridge.  A comfort food staple of Chinese cuisine, it's often served plain with a bunch of side dishes (which they do not do here) or with ingredients such as pork, chicken or fish already inside (which Happy Valley's does do) and is a stand alone meal in itself.  For many Chinese people, if they are sick, they will seek out Congee the way many westerners may look for chicken noodle soup.  It is also a common breakfast staple in that part of the world.\n\nNow back to the story: when the time came and the stars were finally aligned, I was somewhat surprised by the atmosphere of the place.  The vibe was more of a lounge or bar than a regular sit-down restaurant, but it does have \"Congee & Bar\" in the name, so maybe I should not have been surprised.  Also, the music was very loud (and this makes me feel old to write that, but it's true).  There were not a lot of people in the place, so it was easy for the host to find me an open booth.  It was 12:30 a.m. (yes, I am willing to go to great lengths to get the Congee I want) and the music from the club next door could be heard thumping through the wall - but it didn't matter.\n\nI quickly familiarized myself with the menu, but a number of items were not available.  For example, the 1 lb of Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings intrigued me (since for $5.99 it would be one of the cheapest options available every day for Chicken Wings in town) but they were not available as of yet.  But I digress...  I ordered an order of the Century Egg and Pork Congee and a Hong Kong Style Milk Tea (interestingly enough, my server told me that they do not have regular Chinese tea) and soon my prayers were answered.\n\nA perfect bowl of Congee appeared, and through the magic of food I was transported through space and time to the Hong Kong of my youth, the Century Egg a great complement to the salty flavour of the pork.  There were bits of crispy fried wonton skin on top, which gave it some additional texture (Congee purists would no doubt expect to have that crispiness to be provided with a side order of Chinese Dough Fritters accompanying their Congee, but alas there are none to be found at Happy Valley's, at least not with the rather limited menu they do have available at this time).  I thought the Tea was a bit of a miss.  I also added an order of the Salt and Pepper Deep Fried Tofu, but in the end they were missing any discernible flavour besides salt, and I took them home to have later.  I figured they would be better with some sort of sauce.\n\nBut I will be back for the Congee, of this I have not doubt.  All the best to Happy Valley's Congee & Bar another great addition to the ethnic food choices we now have available in Waterloo.", "business_id": "6T0XTVXm9rzx5pJXx5euyQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-11-29", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "V9ZRd0aulWqQj0iMbs1dTA", "review_id": "PXejfoitFzozrHhCBcqRDw", "text": "5.09 deals", "business_id": "6T0XTVXm9rzx5pJXx5euyQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-01-22", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "L6xFHT2HJSnx8iCVS-XrvQ", "review_id": "-bn22J5q6c5i4YrG2yAGYw", "text": "Really glad to finally have a place to eat congee and dim sum near UW!

That's what got me so excited about Hot Wheels.\n\nFor the uninitiated: what is Dim Sum?  Dim Sum is a traditional Chinese brunch that consists entirely of appetizer-like dishes. Portions tend to be bite-sized and made easy for eating with chopsticks.\n\nYes, it's a strange name, but Hot Wheels is a new Chinese restaurant on Victoria near Lancaster (at the site of the former Cleopatra Bar and Grill).  The place just recently opened, but I've got to say I've been impressed with what I have seen so far.  I went for lunch today and although the decor isn't much to look at, the food fails to disappoint.\n\nA quick perusal of the menu (and even the sign out front of the restaurant) shows a great number of spelling and grammatical errors - and surely English is not the first language of the people who own and run this place, but surely I couldn't fault them for that, I am sure they know more English than I do Chinese!  Ordering for Dim Sum is quick and easy, you place your order on the sheet.\n\nOn to the food, which was a delight... Pot stickers to start were cooked perfectly with just a crispy golden brown on the bottom (hence the name, of course).  Shrimp Rice Noodle Roll (Cheung Fun) had great texture and taste, as well as plenty of shrimp.  The perennial Dim Sum favourites of Har Gow (Crystal Shrimp Dumpling) and Siu Mai (Pork and Shrimp Dumpling) were well executed in the standard Cantonese style.  I also ordered the Spare Ribs with Black Bean sauce, which led to my only complaint on the food: it seems that in their quest to give you more pork meat, the pieces of the spare ribs that had lots of little bones, which made it somewhat difficult to eat.\n\nThese five dishes with a pot of Chinese tea and taxes came to under $20!\n\nFor those looking for a more western-style Chinese food experience, there is also the standard dishes combination dishes available and a daily lunch special as well.

It is sooo good. \n\nBoth times I went were on Sundays where they do a four course family style set menu. It is $35 a person and basically all you can eat. The meal starts with a surprise amuse bouche. For Father's Day, it was a huge, perfectly cooked shrimp with a home-made seafood sauce and micro greens. This was followed by a big bowl of salad and a plate of warm, chewy fresh baked focaccia (my favourite part of the meal). Next was a platter of chicken and ribs with sides of roasted potatoes and vegetables. The roasted vegetables were anything but ordinary - among others, beets, zucchinis, cabbage, heirloom carrots, that were perfectly cooked and seasoned. After we ate the full platter of meat, the server came around to ask us if we wanted more. We asked for one serving of ribs and he ended up bringing out an order of chicken too. Dessert was an icecream Sunday with chocolate sauce, peanuts and fresh berries. \n\nAt my second visit, the amuse was a tart filled with a creamy mussel filling. It was interesting, but probably best left as a tiny amuse (I probably wouldn't have eaten a second). This meal came with a similar salad, bread, potatoes and those amazing roasted vegetables.

Waterloo, this is why we can't have nice things! It seems some of these people are accustomed to terrible Mexican/South American food. Hot sauce is not supposed to be laden with thick corn syrup, and a taco isn't meant to weigh as much as a newborn. If you're coming to Taco Farm to strap on the feedbag, you're not going to be happy. This is fresh, high-quality food, served in smaller portions, with a focus on quality. And if you find that every one of the 6-8 tacos has something you don't like, consider trying it and broadening your palate a little.\n\nTacos: The smoked pork belly and beet taco was tasty, but had long, thick strips of pork belly which made them difficult to eat. Chopping the meat would be my suggestion. The roasted beets were an interesting touch, but ultimately a touch too strong for the pork. The shrimp taco was great, full of succulent shrimp in a delicious sauce, and I had no problem getting it made without avocado (I'm allergic to avo). The smoked mushroom taco was also a winner, made crunchy and flavourful with house-pickled vegetables. \n\nAgue Fresca: I liked my rhubarb agua fresca, a great cocktail alternative for those of us staggering back to the office. The server said they'll be changing it seasonally, so I'm definitely looking forward to some blood orange and winter fruit flavours later in the year.\n\nChicken: The much-hyped fried chicken was indeed delicious, with a sweet-tequila glaze on the crispy skin and nicely-brined meat. I would suggest that the chicken come in 2-piece or 4-piece orders, as it's difficult to split the 3-piece standard dish between 2 people. \n\nChurros: Well, these were really the only disappointment. They were a touch doughy, and needed a bit more salt in the dulce de leche to save them from being oversweetened.\n\nWill definitely return, and hopefully a few of the minor niggles can be fixed in the next little while. There were definitely a few problems today at lunch, but overall I'm happy with the experience.

My rhubarb margarita, although creative and refreshing, was in a small glass with a lot of ice. I don't think it was worth $10.\n-FOOD - they serve you complementary chips and salsa which is nice to munch on while you chit chat and wait for the main meal. My boyfriend and I first  had the fried chicken, which was 3 pieces of deliciousness. The tequila-lime-black pepper sauce was so good, I was amazed at how well these flavours worked so well with Fried chicken! On to the tacos... what you have been reading in previous reviews is true- the tacos are very small. However the meal itself is not. We tried the pork belly, beef and shrimp tacos. Even though the soft shell was so small, the meat portion was much more favourable. The shrimp was overflowing, so basically there is not enough shell to cater for the meat. However, if you buy yourself 3 tacos you get a fairly filling $12 meal, which isn't bad at all. You're not uncomfortably stuffed after eating, which is nice. But the shells should be increased in size, especially since they boast making their own tacos from scratch! Even 1 cm larger would be nice. Anyway - the flavours of the tacos were well executed. This is a casual version of fine dining, a nice variation of tacos which is refreshing. the shrimp was well cooked and didn't have that fishy taste. The beef was a bit chewy and the pineapples had to be removed because the flavour overpowered the entire taco..I might as well have ordered 2 slices of pineapple, ha! The pork belly had a nice smoky flavour developed. All in all, impressive.\n-DESSERT- my boyfriend and I decided we wanted churros, with dulce de leche sauce and chocolate sauce. The dulce de leche sauce was much nicer and thicker than the chocolate. Each portion was just enough for 1 person and it was tasty.\nMy ONE main dislike about the dishes is that the complementary chips, fried chicken and churros were all VERY oily. The fried chicken is understandable, but the churros? I wiped it on a paper towel to remove some of the remaining oil. my fingers were glistening by the end of it. \nAll in all - nice lively atmosphere, interesting menu; questionable portion sizes and oiliness are the main concerns.", "business_id": "iZ3mPsUct87y-yBGm_8CrQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-07-05", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "-NJsxI-0fpIwW0P6unlhmQ", "review_id": "0R4iQZ0MDfvLzfOfmArLYA", "text": "The chicken taco was the best one!

The ramen offered at Watami Sushi Bar pales greatly in comparison to that of which is at Kenzo, but that's to be expected considering that Kenzo is primarily a ramen shop.\n\nThe waits are long on weekday afternoons due to the lunch hour rush of university students, so it is best to visit there outside of those hours. The staff are kind and respectful, however during the rush hour, it is quite slow. In terms of decor, the restaurant is well-lit and quite clean. \n\nBut of course, the ramen is the star of the show. I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen, which was $10.95 not including tax. Overall, it was a decent bowl, but still requires improvement if you are used to that which is offered in Toronto or Vancouver. The pork has a good distribution of fat and meat, which was not tough at all. I think that the noodles could be a bit springier, but that's of my own preference. The egg was disappointing; instead of a yellow and slightly runny consistency, it moreso resembled a hard boiled egg. The stock was fairly good; nice and creamy. The bok-choy is a standard offering at Kenzo stands, which was well cooked, but did not really complement the other flavours. Portion-wise, it's a bit small for almost $11. \n\nAll in all, my experience was decent. Going outside of the lunch hour should improve the service however.

We tried the marinated beef one and the filling inside shocked me at how good it was. It tasted like it could be a dish on its own that people would order. One thing that deters me from buns is the soggy bottom that you sometimes get from steaming them and they don't have this at all! The dough is obviously handmade and tastes different from the super sweet buns you'd get in the frozen aisle. A pleasant change - it feels like you're eating real food. Even their homemade chili oil is amazing, I just want to smother everything in it. A little tip: their dumplings and congee are surprisingly good for a hangover.\n\nOverall, I'm really glad there's a place for more wholesome options in the plaza.

Despite the place being mostly empty, we ended up waiting for our food for approx 15-20 minutes. My hubby got the chicken club poutine, which was excellent. I got the regular burger, which was bland as cardboard. There was absolutely no spicing, and even with added toppings, the burger was devoid of taste. The pop machine had lots of selection, which was exciting, but it was hard to use. My fries were good. I decided I'd like to return to try the poutine myself, although I didn't want another burger.\n\nSecond visit: Just came back from my second visit and it was incredibly disappointing. I went with 3 co-workers. 3 of us ordered poutines and 1 ordered a salad and burger. I ordered first, so when my buzzer went, I was surprised to see it was my co-worker's order. We switched buzzers and I expected my order to be next. 10 minutes later, all of my co-workers had their food and Union Burger had completely forgotten about mine. I went up and (after waiting a good 3 minutes for someone to notice me waiting) asked about my food, and they were oblivious. I mentioned my co-workers would all be done eating while I was still waiting for my food. They asked me to sit down and wait, after first asking me 3 times if I was waiting for the Buffalo Chicken poutine (to which I answered back, 3 times, \"No, I'm still waiting for the Chicken Club poutine). 5 minutes later, they gave me my order in a \"to-go\" bag, figuring, I guess, that I wouldn't want to sit and eat even though I'd originally asked for my meal for here. \n\nWhat was even more disappointing is that after I FINALLY received my food, I didn't even get so much as a \"Sorry about the mix up\" apology. I asked if they had comment cards. In response, they gave me a free burger card... which is only apparently valid on Wednesdays. \n\nI don't want a free burger - I want to voice my disappointment at the bad service. And if I did want something from them, it'd be either my money back, or a free poutine since that is what I went in to get. Offering a free burger is a bandaid solution, and it's not even for a gourmet burger! Just their regular, bland as dry toast burger.\n\nDespite the fact that their poutine is great, after 2 subpar experiences in a row, I will spend my money elsewhere - preferably somewhere with better customer service.", "business_id": "ZEztzi5cbAevZ6chnC8YAA", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-06-13", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "Zj2Bmxal_dqBHT0ikVLWHA", "review_id": "RlQjwZHx-TrElshJJD2-_w", "text": "The service is ok and the burgers are ok but the poutine is fantastic so I rate it 4 stars", "business_id": "ZEztzi5cbAevZ6chnC8YAA", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-06-24", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "RqmfPtQCYDSsYSxywrWBkA", "review_id": "87w2G1-Bdwx_jesxa_lelw", "text": "Great burgers an fires here.

However, I would recommend to order half sugar as I find it a little sweeter than the other Chatimes.

The good thing is that their milk tea has a lot more tea flavour than other places. \n\nI have yet to try Noon Moment, so I can't compare. Chatime is just -really- expensive and you might have to line up for a little while. If you go, you might want to get your drink with less sugar because it's really sweet.
