The line is confusing, but just follow everyone else's lead and you'll figure it out in no time. I'm not usually a latte person, but I quite enjoy them at Lux. Maybe it's a psychological effect of the cute latte art. I love their hash with poached eggs, and I'm pretty sure there is crack in the bacon. You can sit inside or outside in front of Pane Bianco next door. \n\nLast time I was in there I ordered a latte and espresso cupcake and instead I received a latte and espresso. I told the barista of the error and she didn't even bat an eye - acknowledged the error and quickly got me a cupcake. No harm, no foul. I don't want baristas who are sugary sweet and ooze with typical fake customer service. I can get that at Starbucks (along with burnt coffee, but that's another review). We're adults here. Just do your job and when mistakes happen quickly fix it. So while other people may complain that the baristas are rude, I quite appreciate the honesty. \n\nYes, there are tons of hipsters.

When I voiced my discontent the waitress assured us that the grilled fish had simply been ""lightly brushed in oil"" and that there was nothing on the broccoli (it was glistening; I ran my finger across it several times and I could have used it as hand lotion it was so heavily coated).\n\nShe offered to take it back and make something different and the manager came to the table and said she understood we weren\'t happy -- a good business move, which I appreciate -- but having invested so many hours in the experience already, and having a headache from the noise, we just wanted to get out of there. \n\nThey boxed the uneaten food, which I put in the frig when I got home for my husband to eat. I took it out the next day and about a quarter cup of oil had slid off the fish and congealed at the bottom of the styrofoam container (I\'m not exaggerating). I ran my finger across the broccoli again just to check that my original assessment had been correct. Crisco city. I ended up tossing it; it was just too disgusting to eat.\n\nThe bill for hours of waiting, deafening noise and greasy, inedible food? $85, not including the tip.

By 9pm, you could hardly hear yourself think. The majority of the women there were middle aged, wearing far too much makeup and dressed in skanky attire. Retired stripper convention? We had to wonder.\n\nWorse, the service was PAINFULLY slow. It took three hours to get through our three courses, with loooong waits in between, and the food was poor to mediocre at best. The grilled artichoke was the most disappointing--undercooked and very spiny. The entrees weren't much better. The portion sizes for the fish my husband and I ordered (Barramundi and blackened Mahi) were laughably small. My stepfather's pork chop looked decent, and my mother's cod, passable. The bread pudding was perhaps the best dish of the evening. The Warm Tarte Tatin (an open-faced apple pie) was the definition of blah, topped with a substandard scoop of flavorless vanilla ice cream. The coffee was weak.\n\nThe bill came to over $300. It was SO not worth it.

The taste was still amazing, but if it says arugula, I expect arugula. I ordered the small size and it was so large it could have easily fed two as an appetizer (in fact, my husband ended up finishing it). \n\nAs a main I had the chicken with asparagus and pine nuts, which was juicy and tender -- just lovely. My husband had the famous duck tacos and lobster bisque; he loved both, but really raved about the tacos. He appreciated that they didn\'t overwhelm the duck with too many other flavors and let the natural taste of the meat shine through. \n\nThe service was bright, efficient and friendly and Sammy\'s has a decent wine list as well (we\'ll have to try their Happy Hour at some point).

I have to inform you that I was very unsatisfied with the work performed on my car and can not, in good conscience, recommend your shop to anyone. \n Let me describe to you my experience.   I discovered a coolant leak that appeared to be coming from the back of the engine in my 1991 Nissan 300zx.  I attempted to discover where it was coming from, to no avail. I brought it to your shop to be pressure tested and diagnosed.   I received a call later that day saying that the system was holding pressure just fine and there was no leak. I explained to the technician that I knew there was a leak somewhere because I was constantly having to refill my radiator.  He came back and told me that he tested the system more, it was still holding pressure, however the radiator cap was not.  They replaced the cap, charging me for the cap and diagnosis then sent me on my way with a list of recommended repairs including a few small oil leaks, transmission pan leak, steering and suspension maintenance.  I kept this list for my reference.  \n At this point, I was very satisfied with the service received, so when my clutch pedal dropped to the floorboard later that week I did not think twice about bringing my car in to your shop for repairs. I trusted the diagnosis that the master and slave cylinders for the hydraulic system for the clutch were leaking. While the repair was being preformed, I received a call to tell me that my water pump was leaking and I was loosing coolant.   I questioned how this could be and why the shop didn\'t catch it when I brought it in for that exact problem mere days before.  He gave me the excuse that it only leaks when its cold, they pressure tested it after it had warmed up and the seals were swollen and therefore held pressure.  This was very careless on on the shops part. The original reason I brought this vehicle in and the original service I paid for was a diagnosis of the engine cooling system. This service was not accurately or appropriately performed or provided. \n Secondly, a mere few days after receiving the car back from the shop after the clutch hydraulic system repair, the clutch began slipping. Now, while it is true that the clutch is a maintenance part that gradually wears out and needs to be replaced, this process can be accelerated by an improper adjustment of the hydraulic system that controls the clutch and I find it far too coincidental that as soon as I had the cylinders replaced and adjusted by your shop, the clutch decided to give out.  I brought this to the technician, and asked him to check the adjustment and inspect the car.  He called me out into the shop to ""show"" me that the hydraulic system was operating properly. What he showed me was that the master cylinder does move when the pedal is depressed.  This information was useless to me and does not prove that it was adjusted properly. He then proceeded to lie to me, telling me that he listed the clutch slipping on the original recommended work list.  I disagreed with him, as I had read the recommended work list that had been given to me and knew it was not on there.  He continued to argue with me, heading back into the office to pull up the document in your computer system, so much for the ""customer is always right"" attitude your shop advertises.   When he pulled it up in the system, and realized I was correct, he did not apologize for his rude and inconsiderate behavior.  The manager (Phil ) merely pushed him out the back door and explained that there was nothing they would do for me because the clutch is a wear and replace part. \n This is unacceptable and I regret to inform you that I will be filing a complaint with the better business bureau and making sure that my friends and the online community are aware of the poor workmanship and service provided by Gregs Japanese Automotive.', u'votes': {u'funny': 0, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 0}, u'stars': 1, u'sentiment': 0.013638716356107663}]"

I like bachi burgers way better.  I got the euro burger.  I thought the oven roasted tomato would be roasted long enough where it created a sweet acidic contrast to the goat cheese it just was so bland tasting, and basic for being 16 dollars. My boyfriend got the hells kitchen burger and the porportians were way off and was overloaded with avocado so you only tasted that, and the jalepinio was barely registering.  My boyfriend wanted the creme brulee oreo shake and once again just not proportionate.  What small amount of oreo shake was in it was super yummy but the creme brulee portion took up like half of it since the bottom of the glasses where the shake is are skinny.  Creme brulee is a very heavy custard and is best served in a shallow dish, and then has the nice crackly caramelized sugar on top.

I dont like the vibe i get from this place, felt like everyone thought they were god's greatest gift on earth, which they aren't but apparently a VIP booth, good looks and bucco bucks buy you the ability to be pretentious and treat others like they are the dirt on your shoe. The line for the restroom is an easy 20 minutes which sucks when you really need to pee. \n\nThe good:\nThe outside balcony is AWESOME. It has an amazing view of the strip that just really makes the energy outside fantastic. There is decent space to move around and stand and just take in the sight or dance if you want. The music they were playing outside was great! My husband loves techno and they were definitely playing the best of it. Inside is your typical mainday radio play hits which were good but I was diggin the music upstairs. Also, if you want good entertainment this place is it. They've got plenty of various rooms, connect to the Pussycat dolls, great balcony out on top, and there is always SOME celebrity there hanging out (Paris and the Olly girls in our case). Additionally, it was a crackup to watch some girl BITCH slap some dude for asking her weight and some guy totally get some from a chick in their VIP booth. Ahhhh! Gotta love the drama. \n\n\nSo all in all, I probably wouldn't go back unless I was gauranteed less than a 20 minute wait and no cover, otherwise its a no go for me.

The waiter was extremely attentive without being annoying. The cranberry and bacon bread was amazing! I don't even like bread but this was something exquisite. My date ordered the Lobster Bisque Soup with a Puff Pastry Dome. It was definitely a larger portion than she anticipated but it certainly was amazing. I had a caesar salad with an egg-less dressing and crisp parmesan cheese ( I held the anchovies). We both ordered the 8 oz fillet, oscar topped. Definitely the best steak I've had in long time. Not the best I've had but what's wrong with a close second. We also had Washington apple martinis as that was the drink on special. I can't remember how it's made but it certainly was unique and tasty. This place is a little pricey. Just two of us came to a little over $200 for what I described above but you're in Vegas, everything is a little pricey. I wouldn't pay that much for USDA prime anywhere else. For that price you can get certified Angus beef or even Kobe. \n\nOverall, this is a great dining experience if you're looking for something more classy and quiet to take your date too while your in Vegas. I'm sad to say that I just heard that Kokomo's will be closing effective January 13th, 2013.

He gave me really awesome Vidal Sassoon bangs and freshened my fading ginger color, and I don\'t know that I would have trusted the student I was assigned with to do that on her own.  While he let her do the basic cutting and applying of the color, he watched her like a hawk which made me feel secure.  It\'s almost more important that the educator is on the ball than the student, because they have to get ""checked in"" on what they are going to do for you, supervised, then ""checked out"" on what they did.  However, be aware that it is a time commitment, and that no student moves very quickly.

Also, the manicure and pedicure services are really lacking.  I don\'t know why they feel they can charge what they do for how limited the services are.  It was a total disappointment, because there was very little filing or buffing done at all.  I don\'t think they even clipped my nails.  Seriously.  My nails got filed for like three minutes, they used some cuticle oil and a stick, then slopped on some polish and threw me in the pedicure bowl.  Basically the same routine down there.

Easy to find within the Monte Carlo, my fianc\xe9 and I decided to sit at the bar and have an easy going, relaxed dinner with drinks. That's exactly what we got! Greeted by a friendly bartender, Wayne, we asked about beers, ordered our drinks and had them quickly. We wanted to order a little, eat, then order some more and that was perfectly fine with Wayne. Started off with the salt and pepper calamari and the jalape\xf1o popper roll, with unagi and eel sauce. Both delicious. The calamari is not your typical touristy ring-style calamari, but rather large yet tasty pieces, perfectly fried with a delicious relish of peppers, onion, salt, pepper and other seasonings. Quite tasty! The jalape\xf1o popper roll was fabulous as well. Not too hot, but a slower, almost smoky heat that creeps up as you savor each bite.  \n\nWe took a short break then ordered some miso soup...fabulously simple but flavorful, and then decided on two more rolls...the traditional Philly roll and their California Volcano roll with crab, cucumber, spicy tuna, green onion, avocado and sesame. Fabulously fresh with the delicate heat from the spicy tuna paired with the sesame overtones, this was probably my favorite bite tonight. \n\nWayne was a great bartender and server with a friendly, relaxed demeanor who was also eager to please, offering suggestions and even samples of a draft beer I hadn't had.

4.16,0,3,"[{u'text': u""I ate here a couple weeks ago and thought the food was pretty great, so I was surprised at all of the negative reviews it got. However, I remembered that I ate here:\n-At 4am\n-while absolutely starving\n-and maybe a bit intoxicated (just a little though, honestly)\n\nSo, that might have hindered my perception. However, I'm going to go ahead and review this place anyway. I promise it's not too inaccurate as I ate here with two other friends who ordered the exact same thing I did and we all raved about it afterwards.\n\nLogistics/Price: It's open 24/7, which is its best advantage. It is also conveniently located about 40 feet from the hotel elevators leading up to the rooms, so if you're already staying in Paris, this is a good place to satisfy some late-night/early morning cravings. The prices during the day are kind of expensive for only average-tasting food, but its late night menu is not bad and sometimes they have certain $8 specials that could be worth it (check the menu right outside the restaurant to see). They also have a random Chinese menu as well filled with basic Americanized Chinese fare (chow mein, fried rice, orange chicken, etc) that ends at 3am but I wouldn't recommend that unless you're really desperate.\n\nAmbience: The cafe is an interesting one right in the Paris hotel. It is not in an actual building at all (no roofs or walls) but is instead in a patio-like area in the corner of the casino, seated in front of the hotel's backdrop of buildings made to look like the quaint establishments in Paris. It literally just looks like someone decided to section off a small corner of the casino and set up some tables and chairs. Despite this however, it doesn't actually look that bad, and is kind of an interesting set up - great for people-watching. \n\nService: From the one time I've been here, I had great service, though  it was at 4am. We were seated immediately and our waitress was helpful, very nice and extremely prompt. We got our food within 15 minutes. \n\nFood: I ate here with 2 other guys and we all decided to order the French Dip - a roast beef sandwich on French baguettes served with Au Jus for about $8-12 (I can't recall the actual price at the moment, but am positive it was in that range). All three of us thought it was delicious. The roast beef was tender and flavorful and the Au Jus was steaming hot and served in a huge bowl - very generous amount. The bread was great, not too hard or chewy, and did not overpower the roast beef. I don't believe there was much else in the actual sandwich though - just roast beef and melted cheese, but from what I recall it was great as is. I actually didn't finish mine and took half of it to go, which I ate the next morning at 5pm and it was still very good (and unrefrigerated too).\n\nMy friend also ordered a Creme Brulee for about $7 and I thought it was fantastic. It was just the right amount of sweetness and felt like it melted in my mouth. Once again though, please keep in mind this was at 4 in the morning while exhausted and starving.\n\nVerdict: A good place for very, very late-night meals - decent food at decent prices. However, only eat here IF you are either already at the hotel, are staying at the hotel, or are desperate for extremely late night food and are already close by. This is not a place to go out of your way to get to (even if out of your way means walking 600 feet up the strip). ."", u'votes': {u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}, u'stars': 3, u'sentiment': 0.15444573283859}, {u'text': u'I went here just yesterday for dinner to celebrate my boyfriend\'s birthday. For a quick summary, here are my thoughts:\n-View: 5 stars.\n-Ambience: 3 stars\n-Service/Wait Time: 3 stars\n-Food: 3 stars\n\nAnd for more in-depth explanation:\n\nView:\nIt\'s a view 800ft above the ground overlooking the strip. And it rotates. It is just as amazing and breathtaking as you would expect. We requested a seat by the giant floor to ceiling windows, which made it even better. We also saw 5 different people jump  for the Stratosphere sky jump, which was great fun to watch. If you want to go somewhere with a great view, this can\'t be beat.\n\nAmbience:\nDespite the gorgeous view, the restaurant\'s ambience was lacking. The decor (table setting, furniture, lighting) appeared very outdated and did not give a sense of elegance. The lighting was especially weak. It did not give the kind of ambience that so many restaurants in LA give. If you take away the amazing view and just look at the restaurant in general, I guarantee anyone would be severely disappointed. In addition, the restaurant\'s website said the business casual dress code was ""strictly enforced"", yet I saw people wearing shorts, flip-flops and tank tops. My boyfriend and I got dressed up for the night and wanted to go somewhere fancy. I think it just really kills the mood and feeling of extravagance when you look behind you and some guy is in a wife beater.\n\nService:\nWe got there at exactly 6:30pm (our reservation time) and was seated right away. However, the hostess brought us to a table that wasn\'t right next to the window, so we asked to be moved. She said it would be a 20 minute wait, which we agreed to. During the wait, we went upstairs to the bar/lounge area, which was nice. It wasn\'t busy at all but it happened to be Happy Hour and we got a 2-for-1 deal on a delicious margarita (some type of orange flavor with pop rocks!). Anyways, we waited for a while and enjoyed the view from the lounge, but then 20 minutes became 30 which then became 40! We finally went back down and they apologized for the long wait and led us to a window table right away. Our waiter was friendly and helpful - not exemplary but certainly not bad. However, our food took another 40 MINUTES to prepare!! I definitely did not expect that long of a wait and was severely disappointed at that (especially because the restaurant was not busy AT ALL. I saw at least 4 empty tables around ours). Overall, the service was fine but the wait time (especially on a slow night) was awful. However, keep in mind that we went there with a $25 gift certificate, which might have affected our service? If so, that is pretty dishonorable. \n\nFood:\nThe complimentary bread/butter they gave was delicious. They give you a plate of three different kinds of butter (regular, garlic, and marmalade) which was awesome and was actually my favorite food of the night (whether that\' s a good or bad thing - you decide).\n\nMy boyfriend had the 10oz. USDA Choice Filet with Red Wine Mushroom Sauce for $53. The portion was quite small and all he had was literally the piece of steak and that was it. No vegetables or anything. The steak itself was good (I had a piece) - tender and juicy. However, it is nowhere near the best steak I\'ve ever eaten and, in my opinion, not worth the price AT ALL! Lala\'s Argentine Grill in West Hollywood, CA has significantly better steaks for around $20.\n\nI had the Fettuccine Seafood Alfredo with Lobster, Prawns and Scallops or $40. It was ONLY OKAY. Honestly, I\'ve had better pasta at casual restaurants like CPK and BJ\'s for around $20 (Baby Clam Linguini with lemon cream sauce at CPK or the Spaghettini with Fresh Clams at the Grand Lux Cafe in the Palazzo are significantly better). The sauce was not creamy and actually kind of cold right at the start. Some of the pasta was even hard/undercooked. However, the prawns and scallops were a hearty size and cooked very well. My plate only had one piece of lobster though, and that was dry and almost tasteless.\n\nSo, overall, if you want to go for the view - DO IT, because the view is amazing. However, I felt the food was NOT WORTH THE PRICE at all and really regret going there. If you have the money to spend, do it. Otherwise, tell them you just want to go up to the Lounge, not the restaurant. You\'ll still get to go up the tower and see the view and if it\'s Happy Hour,you get 2-for-1 martinis! Then, take the money you save and go to the RIO seafood buffet and eat to your heart\'s content.', u'votes': {u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 0}, u'stars': 3, u'sentiment': 0.19674016955266954}, {u'text': u""I have seen quite a few shows in Vegas (Cirque shows, impersonations, revues, etc) and Terry Fator's has got to be one of my favorites.\n\nI am a huge fan of all types of music, and Terry does not disappoint with his impersonations of iconic figures spanning on all genres and decades. Rock, R&B, country, pop, oldies... he does them all. I mean come on, here is a man who does a ridiculous amount of spot-on impersonations (while singing) with his mouth closed. Anyone who dares to tell you that this isn't a jaw-dropping feat should be slapped upside the head and removed from your Facebook friends list.\n\nAs for the show itself - it is lively and entertaining. I think the best word to describe it would be FUN. It is laid back, doesn't take itself too seriously, and is there for you to have a good time. The relatively small stage (in comparison to major Vegas shows) allows you to have a somewhat intimate experience from all areas. I actually had the cheapest seats way in the back (but it was at the center) and still enjoyed the show immensely - heard and saw everything clearly even without the two giant screens beside the stage (though they helped a lot). Strangely enough, there are 4 of these seats kind of sectioned off with a balcony-like area so even though they were the cheapest, it almost like felt like we had private seating! This is a type of show that I believe you'll enjoy it no matter where you sit.\n\nFator himself still remains as humble and down-to-earth as he's ever been. He had a very easy-going, genuine demeanor about him and the show itself uses little special effects or fancy stage distractions. The point is for you to really focus on Fator and what he's doing so that you may truly appreciate his talent. I loved that. The show was also surprisingly funny. Some of the humor was a little corny and he does utilize the 'have someone come on stage' audience participation thing that is reminiscent of comedic magicians, which my friend found a little cheesy as well. There is also a bit of adult/potty humor involved, but I'd still say bringing children is fine because they won't understand it much anyways (though really young ones might not completely appreciate what Fator is doing either).\n\nAlso, if you are not a big fan of music from a variety of genres, this might not be the show for you. I am someone who listens to a wide range of artists, from Journey to Eminem to The Beatles to Garth Brooks to Fleet Foxes to Ne-Yo to the Stones and so on, and I am also a pretty big pop culture nerd in general. This all allowed me to enjoy the show that much more. I recognized every artist and song whereas my friend only recognized about half, which limited her enjoyment (because after all - you can't really appreciate an impersonation if you don't know what the original sounds like).\n\nSo, my suggestion would be to go on YouTube and check out some of this guy's work. He actually allowed people to videotape his performance during the show, which was so surprising and awesome at the same time. It'll give you a feel for what you'll be seeing and I believe is the best indicator of whether you'll like it or not (but don't watch too many videos or the show will be spoiled for you! I'd recommend just checking out his America's Got Talent performances). At 90 minutes, the show felt perfectly paced. If you're looking for an entertaining Vegas show that showcases REAL TALENT (and is also not a huge wallet buster) - then this is the one for you!"", u'votes': {u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}, u'stars': 5, u'sentiment': 0.17681401931401933}]"

Taste It Tours seemed like the best one, they had good reviews online and they were located in Downtown Phoenix. I must say, is was really impressed! \n\nOne of the main things I wanted from a food tour was to GET FULL and HAVE FUN. The Taste It Tour team provided just that with an urban experience. The tour started at the Ghost Lounge at The Hotel San Carlos and ended at My Big Fat Greek Express in Cityscape. In between we hit a number of great places including a local hidden gem 1130 The Restaurant and the popular Hanny's. \n\n1. The Ghost Lounge in San Carlos Hotel - I had never been to the San Carlos Hotel or the Ghost Lounge. I enjoyed hearing the local history and haunted stories. The tour guide did a great job at keeping us our toes and giving us a hint of what to expect for the rest of the evening. At the Ghost Lounge we were given a Margarita and it was delicious. It was smooth and hit all the points of a margarita but it didn't have that corny margarita mix taste, which is key for me! \n\n2. Hanny's - I've been to Hanny's twice before and knew a little of the history but had no idea about the glass elevator, the haunted doll room and the doll perched on the outside window on a top floor! BTW, that totally freaked me out. We sampled Hanny's famous flat bread pizza, which never disappoints. Nothing new for me, since I've had both pizzas before, but I enjoyed the history. \n\n3. 1130 The Restaurant - This stop was probably worth the entire tour. Lobsters, Mussels, Mojitos.. Oh My! Lobster.. on a food tour? Exactly. Oh, and everything was so good. The Lobster was the perfect serving size nestled in a bed of lettuce with a Thai type sauce to top it, the mussels were cooked to perfection and seasoned lightly on a bed of buttered pasta and the Mojitos were perfect, not too sweet. Not to mention, the location was well worth it. My first time there and I'll be back very very soon.\n\n4. My Big Fat Greek Express - I was a little wary of this stop. I've been here many times at different locations and although I love it, I didn't think it was food tour material. But then again, they surprised me. The waiter brought out this wonderful flaming cheese that was smoky and spicy, I also got a tasty lamb and beef sampler platter, I got a Baklava that was really sweet, it was good, a little too sweet for me, but for the sweet tooths in the group it was a hit. Oh, and a Sangria finished it off. The Sangria was really sweet as well, but for the sweet tooths in the group, again a hit. \n\nAll in all, it was worth every single penny. I left stuffed, had a great time. It was really fun. Definitely recommended for out of towners and locals.

There is a menu describing the combinations and what they are good for). There is also an area with juices, water, cold tea, coffee, fruit, and pretzels. \nThe showers are great with a vanity area with everything you need, including hairdryers, straighteners, hair spray, spray deodorant, toothbrushes, razors (good ones too!), etc. \n\nHints: If you are in town during any day Monday - Thursday, they have weekday specials on their website. The special changes every couple of months. \n\nIf you don\'t have time for a full service (such as massage, etc), you can pay a small fee ($25?) for a \'day pass\' and use all the amenities.

I also made myself some organic green tea from the coffee and tea table where they had many teas to choose from.\n\nCons:the spa facility is a little small.

The staff was great and helpful when we had questions.\n\nWe were in building 18 in a one bedroom. The room was great. All of the appliances looked new and worked well. The whole place was extremely clean. There was a washer and dryer in a workroom off of the balcony. The balcony had a small table and two chairs.  There was a large TV in the living room and another in the bedroom (we were estimating 42""). They looked new and even had a place to plug in the HDMI cable we brought so we could watch stuff off of our laptop. There was a DVD player in the living room. The free internet worked great. \n\nThere was a shuttle that went to the strip and other places around town. We did not use the shuttle but talked to several people who did and said it was great and ran often. We had our own car but at night when we knew we would be drinking, we just walked to and from the strip. It is behind the Imperial Palace (which is across the street from Ceasars). To walk to the strip you have to walk past an empty dirt lot and then you are in the Imperial Palace parking garage. It isn\'t ideal, but I felt pretty safe since it is a large dirt lot and there wasn\'t anywhere for anyone to hide or jump out at you. You would see someone coming from very far away. \n\nWe did get to hang out at the pool for awhile. There are 5 clusters of buildings and each has it\'s own pool area. Each pool is ""themed"" but there wasn\'t much difference between them. Ours had an outdoor hot tub and an indoor hot tub. There was a little building with a workout area, the hot tub, and in the women\'s dressing room/bathroom there was a sauna. The outdoor pool was heated (this was Nov) and there were people swimming. One of the pool areas has a ""mini-golf"" but it looked like just one hole. Still, it might entertain children for a few minutes. We did not have our kids with us this time so we did not check out the game room, but I know they have one. We did not do any of the activities, but it looked like lots of fun stuff for kids and families to keep busy during the day.\n\nWe have stayed at a Wyndham time share in Vegas off of Harmon a couple years ago. It was comparable to this one (although I think this one was better for walking to strip). We would definitely return to either of these - with or without the kids.

I did not think it was worth the $20 extra, but he enjoyed it. \n\nThe women\'s area had a double sized jacuzzi/hot tub, dry sauna, steam room, and nice large showers. The dressing area was fully equipped with everything for getting ready for a night out if you don\'t want to go back to your room. (We were at a different hotel across town so I got ready here at the spa).  From what my husband described, the men\'s area was similar. They also had lots of juice, tea, and lemon water that was included. Fruit and granola were also available in the lounges.\n\nWe each had some ""alone time"" in the secluded areas and then met in the roman pool area which was co-ed. There are little alcoves with nicely padded benches. We sat in one and sipped champagne (which was part of our package) and then got in the pool.

We really enjoyed the pool and stayed in until we were pruned.\n\nWe had also gotten the deal from Travel Zoo (which I see they are already offering again). If you get the deal, it is very worth it.

So now to try this one! \n\nLine is long of course, and prices are cheap for a decent buffet (better than Hometown Buffet!!!). Instead of my GOOD/BAD kind of review, I will pin point each station, as all of them have their positive and negative aspect. Itallian and Chinese were skipped cause they're my frequent eats at home.\n\nLINE: I expected a long wait as it was up Central Cali. When it got to the inside of the place for the line, it was way too stuffed once you get to the cash register. There was barely any room to move an inch. They really need to fix this, especially some of us are carrying drinks in our hands. \n\nSODA FOUNTAIN: Lots of variety, and a little messy. \n\nSERVICE: Pretty attentive at some points, and sometimes not so much. I feel like they shove a waiter/waitress to one area, and just only one waiter/waitress per area, and this place is pretty big. It took awhile to get a refill of my drink cause our waitress was nowhere to be found. She had to take care of the whole side of the room :/ Plus, when we arrived, we notice she also was in charge of cleaning the floors. So they need more staffing and not skimp out or put a soda fountain available for customers to get themselves, cause a lot of people were needing refills and getting upset (no no, not just me).\n\nBREAD: Good selections. I really enjoy the buttery cheese biscuits! they're almost like the ones from Red Lobster ^.^ \n\nSEAFOOD: I didn't get to taste a lot since they ran out most of the time :[ So I stuck with popcorn shrimp.\n\nMEATS: Well, I wanted to try a bbq slider or steak slider, but it keeps running out @.@ \n\nMEXICAN: I should of skipped this! At the other GC, I made a fajita and that was enjoyable. In this station, I tasted the enchilada, and it was bland and weird. I guess cause I'm so used to my bf's mom's authentic Mexican cooking. But what really turned me off was their tortilla chips. They're so thin and tasted like paper. Why had they not use corn tortilla?!\n\nOTHER: They have sweet baked potato and that was delicious, and OH! real bacon bites for it! YUM! Like actual bacon, not the red hard rock fake ones. I also like their bourbon chicken a lot.\n\nDESSERT: My favorite of course. The chocolate fountain, cookies, ice cream, and cotton candy~ BUT for that line for ice cream, it's so disorganized :/ kids and people are cutting in front! And you don't even know if the person in front is going for the swirly ice cream machine or the scooped ice cream.\n\nSo my expectations were a little high on service and organization, cause the one up Central, is superb than this.

The sauerbraten consisted of thin slices of beef which was nothing like I remembered from visits to Germany. The flavor was mild and hard to understand why Guy Fieri raved so much about it on his show.  The Wienerschnitzel was greasier than I would have preferred but it was a huge serving that covered half the plate.  The German fried potatoes were good but would have been much better had they been hot.  The spatzel and red cabbage was as expected but unremarkable.\n\nWe finished the meal sharing a large slice of the Saurkraut cake which was the best part of the meal.  Overall the cost of the three entrees, two appetizers, one dessert and two small beers was $103 + tip.  \n\nWe came with high expectations (perhaps too high) and left somewhat disappointed.

There was also an artist room, with instruments and information by artist--John Lennon, Paul Simon, Eric Clapton, and yes, even Jonas Brothers (yikes).

There is shopping where ever you turn you head to. There are bars themed bars that will sell you a 40 OZ replica guitar filled with margarita or any common alcoholic frozen drink of your poison. Pretty much you can reenact the Hangover movie experience, or go have a bacherlorette groupie and do what ever your what and even a guy's weekend to do anything you desire. It is true that what ever happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas, except your money and a credit card bill when you return home of course. When you go, just go ahead and budget to spend without too much worries. You only live once.\n\nSo, one of my quest in Vegas was to find This buffet that everyone keeps talking about. I wanted to see what the hype was about since it was even located at The Wynn Hotel.\n\nWhen you walk into the entrance of the buffet, you can notice a whole lot of flower arrangements and butterfly tiles. The owner of the place, Steve Wynn (one of the richest man in the world, by the way) apparently is Buddhist and lives the way of circle which explains a lot about the decor and red and a whole lot of butterflies. I was told by my pals in Philly that the seafood side was pretty good for a buffet. So, I rushed to that side immediately after I ordered my drink. Behold, a mound of giant king crab legs sliced in half to help the eater easily extract the meat without any difficulty. They make it so easy for you. The jumbo cocktail shrimps are mostly peeled and the butter is dispense into a mini bowl. The only thing missing that would have made it extremely effortless to eat my seafood platter I made was that they should have had a lemon juice dispenser. They had prime rib there. They had everything you would see at a thanksgiving supper like whole turkey carved. They had Sushi hand rolls, Sashimi, clam chowder with real claims and chunks of chicken, chicken noodle like mama intended it to be like, Chinese take out style gourmet foods, and everything you would look for in a buffets.\n\nMy only complaint at the place was that I though the desserts weren't so great compared to other places I have been to. I mean they have a decent Gelato stand, but the cakes and everything else was so disappointing. Their french crepes were small and too powdery. They need to make it bigger like the Paris Hotel's Buffet. They also should serve creme brulee with less caramelized sugar on top and they should use a smaller torch. This is not shop class meets cooking. It certainly was not as good as it should be. I would not recommend their creme brulee because it seemed rushed and poorly prepared. The fruits tasted like water. I mean everything looked great, almost like a piece of art. I would say, stick with the ice cream and the food there at this buffet, and your experience would be satisfying enough.\n\nFor a 40$ buffet, it's a okay.

I asked for a refrigerator, and she had room service bring it right up!!!\n\nThe room was CLEAN, did NOT smell bad, had a pretty good view, a balcony, free ice machines right outside the door, the A/C worked great, the drains did NOT clog, we had a nice big flat screen TV, and the hotel maids came every day to change our trash and give us towels.  Plus we were right next to their supply room so we could get more towels when we wanted ;)  Above all - it was amazingly quiet!  For a light-sleeper, that\'s saying a lot!  \nThe 2 queen beds were nice, comfy, and clean -  not what some of those horrible pictures where on some of the reviews I\'ve seen.\nThe hotel had the perfect stores and cafes to get whatever you needed.  There was great prices on beer, and their little cafe had hot food and even some healthy food too.  And an ice cream parlor! lol.\n\nI only walked through the casino to go out the front entrance and it looks great.  Their quickie mart was awesome too.\n\nParking situation: not bad!  The other reviewers just think it\'s bad because they don\'t have common sense or know how to read friggin\' directions (left for Harrah\'s, and right for the Quad! Duh!).  It was a little confusing on how to get up the structure at first, but there\'s a little guy riding a bike around and you can ask him for help.  It literally only took us 10 minutes to find a parking spot and head toward the check in counter.  Such complainers on this yelp site!\n\nTips:\n1.) elevator #2 and #4 worked the best in tower 1.  I heard tower 4 is a bad so ask not to be there.\n2.) be really nice to the staff, ok?! Like, kill them with kindness.  \n3.) check in on a Monday-Thursday.  You\'ll be greeted with a nicer attitude from the check in people and they\'ll be able to cater to your needs more because there will be more rooms available.\n4.) bring a FAN to air out the bathroom - the vent doesn\'t work and it sure gets stuffy and hot in there.  I brought a box fan and it was the best thing I brought!\n5.) bring a power surge thing.  If you have a lot of people it\'ll save you!\n\nWe spent 4 days here and honestly I couldn\'t have asked for a better situation given that we only paid $400 for 4 nights (I booked in January and traveled in June during one of the highest-traffic times of the year).  Pretty darn good deal if you ask me.  I would stay again, but I like to try other hotels.', u'votes': {u'funny': 0, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 0}, u'stars': 4, u'sentiment': 0.23290491854636597}]"

I have no idea what that\'s like, and if it\'s the same quality as the sushi, it\'s probably pretty good.\n\nThat being said, here\'s the explanation for the rating:\n\nWe went in a group of four, mostly because I wanted sushi, and it was close by. We had an easy time parking, probably because it was 3 in the afternoon, but we soon found out that was the only benefit to arriving at that hour of the day.\n\nThe hostess was very kind and cheerful, but instead of suggesting our available options, asked us open-endedly (and somewhat confusingly) how she could help us for dinner. I can understand this response when you walk into a retail store and there are lots of options, but really, when you\'re a restaurant host/ess, the most you\'re going to be able to offer is table, bar, or takeout (in this case, we didn\'t know what our options were, so it would have been good if she had offered some). Seeing a group of four, with a little brain power, one can probably infer we wanted a table. Perhaps a silly point, but it started us off on a somewhat awkward foot.\n\nThe waitstaff was efficient, but easily confused and didn\'t seem to understand our questions or requests very well, as though there were a language barrier to a degree.\n\nThe sushi (my dish) was well presented, fresh and tasty, but I had to pay $6 more for a meal that would have cost me less if I had come in (possibly) even a half an hour earlier. The menu listed both lunch and dinner items but had no indication when one menu ceased being served and the other started, but to the best of my knowledge, 3 P.M. is a very early dinner time even for people who eat early suppers.\n\nFor the price that we paid (around $18/person) the other food did not seem up to par. My husband ordered Chicken Yaki Soba, and our friends ordered and shared a dish of Chicken Teriyaki that was definitely large enough for both of them to share and had two sauces which were identified neither by the waitstaff nor the menu. The Yaki Soba was *ok*, and the vegetables that came with the chicken teriyaki were a little less than lukewarm and the chicken itself, in both the Teriyaki and Yaki Soba were dry. Needless to say, we had to pay dinner prices for food that had been obviously hanging around after lunch.\n\nI might recommend this place as a good location for lunch sushi, because the lunch prices for sushi were very reasonable, and the sushi was very fresh and the chef seemed to know what he was doing. Even at a lower price the other food was not well made. Make sure you go specifically at ""lunchtime"" because otherwise you\'ll be stuck with dinner prices in the middle of the afternoon, and you might get better quality entrees than we did.', u'votes': {u'funny': 1, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 1}, u'stars': 2, u'sentiment': 0.09471331389698734}]"

Its chopped small, roasted and then grilled for a crispy texture.

A place in Santa Cruz called Tacos Morenos, whose own legend can be heard on the wind of a warm October night. \nUnlike morenos, who uses pintos and a thin layer of melted cheese on the burrito, this one contained rice and refried beans.

This is probably why I will order them again, because it was a little different. But in the end, I think its a flavor thats not really up their alley. They need to stay their lane on this one.

The arugula fries on the side were some of the best fries I\'ve ever had as well, and went amazingly well with their homemade ketchup.\n\nThe cocktails were expensive and didn\'t contain anything that particularly stood out at me, but I\'m sure they\'re great if you like what\'s in them.

The sommelier brought the wine over, showed the bottle to my fianc\xe9e, asked him of he'd liked it decanted, he answered yes. Then the sommelier put the bottle down and walked away. About 10 mins later the waiter came over and opened the bottle, then promptly threw the cork in the trash. After tasting, he poured it in our glasses.\n- I was lusting after the escargot for our appetizer and was told about 10 mins after I ordered it that they were out.\n- When we arrived we were told our table was running about 10 mins behind, so we went to the bar. For my pre-dinner drink I ordered my standard dirty martini w/ blue cheese olives. The waitress at the bar told me they may be out of the blue cheese olives so I asked if they could stuff some for me. She gave me some snide comment about it. For a French restaurant at this price point I should have never been told they may be out - did they run out of olives or blue cheese? No. They may run out of those that they stuffed already earlier in the night - stuff some more.\n- My mother and I ordered the special, fillet w/ crab on top and 4 asparagus spears. I didn't ask the price, so that was a bit my fault if I really cared, but the regular fillet of the same size was about $30 less than the special turned out to be. Not worth the ~1oz of crab on top of the fillet. Even besides that, the fillet wasn't great. \n\nIt feels like nit-picking when looking at what I've written, but for a nice dinner out, where we took my Mom & Dad out for their birthdays, when in the end we had a $600 bill for 4 people, both my fianc\xe9e and I had the same 'ehh, not worth it and won't go back' feeling of the entire night, especially the 'ehh-ness' of the food.

The price point was higher; we spent around $100 per person, with drinks appetizers and salads, main courses and sides (this is excluding the 2 bottles of wine).

The wait staff was nothing but friendly and helpful, other than the sommelier which left some to be desired. He didn't really know the wines, and just didn't seem like he wanted to be there given his comments. I think the only thing that was a standout negative was the napkins. I think because they are new, they have a lot of lint coming off of them, so every time someone would get up to use the restroom and the wait staff would fix the napkins, the lint would fly in the air and get in the glasses.

I brought in a coupon for my 100k maintenance that said they\'d do it for $129, but when I got there they would not honor it, the lowest price they would give me is $200. The reason being because I drive a Nissan it\'s way more expensive. The moment my boyfriend got there (he was my ride) the price dropped from $200 to $180, still not the advertised price but it was better. If my boyfriend hadn\'t recommended the place, I would have left after how they blatantly changed their tone, price, and respect once they were dealing with a male, regular customer. \n\nThe only reason they get to keep 3 stars instead of getting a 1 star review is that they did end up doing a decent job on the maintenance.

They are lucky they had that going for them b/c the rest of it...not so good. \n\nMy husband and I checked out the menu online before our trip and basically decided on what we were going to get. We also checked the dress code, which stated ""business casual"". I wore a dress (I NEVER wear dresses) and my husband wore a suit jacket and a nice button up shirt with nice slacks. We walked over to Binion\'s and finally found the correct elevator after asking a few employees, and made our way up to the top. No glass elevator. =(  Everything was going good thus far- the maitre d (this guy was wearing a ring on every finger, he looked like an old school mafia boss or pimp lol) seemed a little smug, but we were expecting that since this was supposed to be a nice place. \n\nIn our reservations I stated that this was a special occasion and asked for a table by the windows if available. They accommodated us with this great table right next to the windows, kind of off by ourselves. Great view, great music, no one directly next to us, everything was perfect so far. Our waiter started off great, but we didn\'t actually see him for the rest of our meal until he brought the check - more on that in a second. I ordered the petite filet and my husband ordered the chicken fried lobster, since they are supposed to be famous for it. Remember me saying we had looked at the menu beforehand? Well they need to update their menu prices online. Everything was like $10 to $20 more on their actual menu than they had quoted online. I know inflation happens, but come on...update your website! Money wasn\'t an object, but still, UPDATE.\n\nA few minutes after ordering, a loud table of 4 was seated right next to us....there were a ton of open tables a few feet away, why couldn\'t they have gone over there?! They were not busy so I don\'t think it would have been an issue for our section\'s waiter to walk an extra 4 feet. Anyway, the loud table was sat next to us and they were all dressed in motorcycle tshirts and old jeans, with baseball hats. I noticed a few more tables coming in with ratty looking tshirts and holey jeans. I think we were the only table dressed up! I am not a snob, people can wear whatever they want, but I put on a dress and heels b/c it was supposed to be business casual, so I think they could have come in with a freaking polo shirt on or something! And the snobby maitre d didn\'t say anything....maybe they tipped him, who knows. Ok, so the loud table next to us all ordered water, and they managed to get better service from the wait staff than we did - we ordered drinks. I heard what they ordered (how could I not) and our 2 person check was going to be more than their 4 person check, and our waiter was kissing their asses. As I said before, we only saw our waiter when he took our order and when he dropped off the check. We didn\'t get a refill until my husband tried to refill his water himself (they had giant bottles of water sitting off to the side) and out of the 3 waiters / workers we saw walking around, no one asked how our meal was. They sure as hell asked the table next to us how everything was, multiple times. \n\nOn the the food: the filet was burnt...charred severely. I asked for medium, not black. It didn\'t even taste like a filet, I think they gave me the  scraps from someone else\'s steak. The potatoes were the best thing on my plate sadly. The house salad was drenched in dressing, which would normally we fine, but there was so much that I couldn\'t finish it. My husband got the caesar and he seemed to enjoy it. His chicken fried lobster was gross. We\'ve both had better fried seafood from Long John Silvers or Red Lobster. The lobster itself was just not good. My husband will usually push through something he doesn\'t like, b/c he\'s paying for it, but he wouldn\'t even finish this dish.  I told him to send it back, but we would have had to see a waiter for that to have even happened. 20 or so minutes went by with us sitting there waiting for a waiter to come back to ask how our meal was. Neither of us had touched very much on our plates, that should have been a sign to the wait staff that something was wrong. Clue number 2 would have been us looking around for someone that worked there. I\'m serious, if the mafia looking maitre d had not been outside we would have dined and dashed, it was that bad. \n\nWe stayed and paid, and gave a fair tip (even though we shouldn\'t have given our waiter anything b/c he didn\'t DO anything) and on our way out we passed 2 employees and the maitre d....no one said \'thanks for coming in\', \'enjoy your night\', \'kiss my ass\'....nothing.

Didn't look too busy, so we put our names on the list and took a seat outside. We overheard someone say that if you sit at the bar you'll get served faster and you don't have to put your name on the list, so we tried that....didn't work. There are 4 or so chairs at the bar, so there went that idea. More waiting, waited so long that we had to eat a snack bar I had in my bag....before we ate lunch! I think our wait totaled about an hour for just the 2 of us. We were seated and it took our waiter 10 minutes before he came over to greet us and take our drink orders. Found out a few of the items that were on the menu were not supposed to be on there any longer (one of the items I was going to order, figures), so my husband ordered the grilled cheese with tomato soup and I ordered the mac & cheese. Simple enough. Our free frozen hot chocolate came out in this giant sundae glass,it was amazing! So good! We were expecting a tiny glass since it was free, but this could have fed a family of 4! Our food came out 35 or so minutes later, and my mac & cheese tasted like lighter fluid! It was so gross that even thinking about it right now makes me gag a bit. My husband's grilled cheese was gross too, same lighter fluid taste. Even his soup tasted like lighter fluid! I assumed it was the way they were cooking things so we brought this to the waiter's attention. He took my food back and came back to tell us that the cooks had no idea why it tasted like that and that no one else had complained. He offered to replace my gross food with something else, so I ordered a hot dog. Figured it would be safe since it wasn't covered in whatever gross cheese they were using. \n\nWe waited for my hot dog for 30 minutes!  A HOT DOG! I'm kind of hypoglycemic so by this point I was feeling pretty weak. I started spacing out, feeling nauseated, it was all I could to stay calm. My hot dog FINALLY came and I was at that point in my 'episode' where I was super nauseated, so I took a few bites and got a to-go box, which took another 10 minutes. It was just annoying how much time we spent waiting and the food wasn't even good. I ate my hot dog an hour or so later after I was feeling better and it was pretty good. If I ever went there again i'd go straight for that and a frozen hot chocolate, that's it. And i'd get it from the to-go window, not even bother going inside.

Lots of dispensers in the middle of the room eagerly waiting for you to put a bag or a bucket under it's spout.

I didn't get to sample their gelato or crepes but I hear they are delicious. \n\nMade it out of the store a little poorer, but it was worth it.

Service was attentive but only by our waiter's helper - our waiter took our order then went missing until time for the check. The assistant was great, he deserved all of the tip but I doubt it ended up that way. \n\nChicken Parmesan was huge, definitely big enough to share. We each got a chicken breast and a large portion of spaghetti so I'm glad we split it. The spaghetti sauce was amazing, I'm still dreaming about it. Noodles were cooked perfectly. Chicken was cooked nicely, no complaints about the meal at all. Our Lobster Tail was a little hard though, like it was either over cooked or a few days old.

But if you\'re desperately in need of lodging or if you\'re looking for somewhere a bit more quiet, the PH towers are a good option.\n\nSo, I found out that I was going to CES this year two days before CES.  This doesn\'t allow for much time to plan and doesn\'t allow for many options for accommodations or flights.  After scrambling to find a hotel and doing some hardcore sleuthing on google/kayak/orbitz/travelocity/farecast/etc, I can up empty handed.  Empty handed being Circus Circus, Stratosphere or off the strip hotels (everything else was solid booked) and a $780 non-stop flight from Oakland to Vegas or SFO to Long Beach to Vegas with a 6.5 hour lay over (again, all other flights were solid booked).  Fail.  I considered driving.  Or not going.\n\nI couldn\'t not go, however.  Some intensive googling (read: 4th page of results) led me to a shady looking hotel broker site (http://www.bookit.com, slogan: ""You know what to do."")  They had rooms available at the PH towers, and not only that, they were 40% off.  Of course this was a scam.  Or was it?  I called PH reservations, they said ""we\'re all booked"", I said no, the *towers*, they said oh yeah, plenty of room.  I said why.  They said, uhhh it just opened on December 28th and nobody knows about it.  (It wasn\'t even listed as a hotel on hotels.com, travelocity, orbitz, etc).  I went back to bookit.com and ""booked it"" hoping that I hadn\'t just screwed myself.\n\nWhen I arrived in the carport area of the Towers, there wasn\'t a single person or car in sight.  Hmmm.  I went inside (everything was brand new, uber modern theme) and up to the lobby.  At the front desk there were spots for 20 reservationists but there was only one person there checking people in.  When I got up to desk, she looked up my name... long, anxious pause... she pulled it up, and everything was fine. \n\nSome stuff about the Hotel that the website or brochure won\'t tell you:  The towers are mixed residences and hotel accommodations.  The main entrance is located off of the back end of the Miracle Mile Shops--a mall of questionable quality and curation.  It\'s a 10 minute walk from the hotel to the main PH casino and hotel.  There\'s something that looks like a bar in the lobby of the Towers but I never saw anyone there.  There are no restaurants.  There are no usual hotel amenities--spa, starbucks, gift shop, etc.  The pool area looks more like a public swimming pool and faces one of the main roads off of the strip. Room service has limited hours and it made me wonder where the food comes from since there\'s no dining establishments in the Towers. \n\nOn the plus side, the rooms are brand new studios, 1 bedrooms and suites.  My studio was small by hotel room standards and average by Manhattan apartment studio standards with a view of the MGM but not the strip.  I think I might have been the first person to ever use the room.  It smelled like cleanliness and there was no sign of anybody ever having occupied the space.  The room came with a kitchenette, full set of dish-ware, a dishwasher, full wall to wall, floor to ceiling windows with a remote controlled shade.  The linens were stiff and nice.  The bed was firm.  The towels shed lint everywhere, I presume from having never been washed and dryed before (they were brand new).  The toilets are black, which is weird (use your imagination). \n\nOne of my favorite parts of Vegas hotel rooms are the completely opaque shades that can make 2pm seem like 2am and help you recover from something that may have ended at 7am.

Also, hung out at Stone Rose Bar quite a few time and enjoyed that as well. The hotel is large, but they do have golf cart service to help you get around if need be. Besure and have breakfast there at the restaurant  and ask for TIM. He was wonderful and I can\'t wait to go back and visit. Loved it!

A place like this I would have expected a clear mug to showcase the drink...nope, didn't happen.  I know some of this may seem like petty things but...our bill was close to $100 for the 3 dinners, drinks oh...and an appetizer.  The entrees did not come with any type of salad offering either.

I had a very friendly waiter named David who was quite helpful. He was good enough to warn me that the side portions were ""family style"" and that it might be too much food to order 2 sides with my steak. Nice, most waiters would have simply scribbled down the order and ran to the kitchen. \nI had a filet with a side of peppercorn sauce and the au gratin potatoes. It would have been nice if they offered smaller sides; I would have had asparagus but since the sides are huge I decided on only one. The steak did not disappoint. It was buttery soft, served similar to Ruth\'s Chris with a little butter on a hot plate (not nearly as much butter though, which in some ways is a positive). I had several bits of the steak without the peppercorn sauce to verify the taste of the beef. It was very nice, although it could have had slightly more beefiness to it. I realize this is dangerous territory since most gourmets would probably say that\'s exactly as it should be, but at this point I am comparing all steaks to Harriss\' in San Francisco, and I\'m happy to say (because I live within walking distance to Harriss\') that I don\'t think this one was quite as good. As for the au gratin potatoes, they are pure heart stopping bliss in a nice hot dish. Cheesy, gooey, potatoey, baconey heaven in a bowl. Nice Southern cajun accent to the dish. \nSo, I\'d definitely go to Del Friscos again because it certainly doesn\'t suck. I am still on the quest though for the better steak. Rumor has it that MIchael Minna is offering the only true Kobe steak in town (in Vegas that is). May have to investigate further.

It was packed and loud, so I guess that\'s a good sign. \nTo be honest, I wasn\'t impressed with our waiter. He seemed like a casual Billy Corgan type who was interested in talking to you so long as you were increasing your order. No small talk, 0 personality, and the real piss ant is he conveniently didn\'t add our restaurant.com coupon to our bill. He may have forgotten, but frankly this is the second time this has happened to me in Vegas, and seeing how just about every other attraction in Vegas is designed to suck the money out of your pocket I can\'t help but wonder if it\'s not a coincidence. They must slip more than a few bills under the noses of patrons who unknowingly assume they got their discount but fail to check after a bottle of wine, but not me, and I\'m not too forgiving about this ether, because I think it really is intentional. \nAnyway, the food is what saved this place from a more negative review because in the end that is all I really and truly care about anyway. Anyone can learn how to carry a plate of food to a table, but it takes a talented individual to craft a work of art in the kitchen. \nWe had salad to start. Frankly I wasn\'t impressed with my caesar.  It seemed a bit bland. I was hoping this wouldn\'t be precursor to the rest of the meal but in this rare occasion it wasn\'t at all. Salad must not be their thing because the rest of the meal was mind blowing. I had a regular filet with a side of peppercorn sauce and another side of the creamed corn. Ummmm....the food was utterly fantastic. The filet was of EXCELLENT quality. Perfect taste and texture throughout, and the accompanying pepper sauce was not a creamy peppercorn sauce like you usually get, but more of a demi glace sauce with peppercorns - truly the sauce I have been after for years.\nThe sides of the mashed potatoes 3 ways was stunning. They serve 3 little bowls of mashed taters. One is sour cream and chives infused, the other is lobster infused, and the third is horseradish infused. Each was the creamiest, smoothest mashed potato I have ever had, and was accented perfectly with its character ingredient. Wow. With the steak it was just superb. The creamed corn with jalapeno was very good, although not the best ever. Still very nicely done though and no complaints.\nTo top it off, and the reason this place is a solid 5 star experience and worthy of one of the most smitten reviews I have ever posted was the simple divine experience I had with the Executive Chef, Ben (lost his business card but remember his name).\nI was walking out of the restroom, and stopped by to look at their see-through window next to the grill where they cook the steaks and other entrees. I noticed what seemed to be a chef standing nearby, so in a spontaneous moment of gratitude I went up to him and told him how much I enjoyed my food. He was very nice, and after I asked a few more questions about how the steak is prepared, he said ""come on, I\'ll take you back."" He actually took me back in the kitchen past all the kitchen staff who were probably thinking ""WTF is this guy doing in here?"", and took me straight up to the grill where a few beautiful steaks were in the home stretch. He explained the process, how the steaks actually soak in clarified butter at a perfectly controlled temperature before they are grilled. This would explain the awesomeness of the steak, actually, but now that I\'ve tasted it I know that it\'s the best. He enthusiastically answered my other questions about the kitchen (""is it really like Hell\'s Kitchen??"") and then ushered me out of the kitchen. I don\'t know why this is such a big deal to me, but it really just impressed the heck out of me that the Executive Chef of one of the best restaurants I\'d ever been to was so down to Earth and gave me an impromptu tour of his kitchen. I remember as a young boy my dad would approach the cockpits of planes even during flights sometimes to talk to the pilots, and they would bring us into the cockpit, explain a few neat things, and then with a wink we\'d be on our way. Obviously those days are gone forever, but tonight I had a bit of the same feeling; the man running the ship gave me the tour with no expectation of anything in return. Clearly I don\'t believe this kind of thing happens that much anymore and that\'s why I\'m so ecstatic, but it was a privilege and an honor to meet him and I cannot thank him enough for his exemplary skills as both a chef and a business man. \nI\'m a fan of Strip Steak for sure. Maybe next time if I win big in Vegas I\'ll try the Japanese Kobe (it\'s not cheap). Until then I\'ll enjoy a superb domestic cut of beef and be glad I can afford the luxury.', u'votes': {u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}, u'stars': 5, u'sentiment': 0.26372974101921476}, {u'text': u'I couldn\'t find tickets at one of the ""Tix 4 Tonight"" booths that sell tickets for shows at much better prices than the shows\' box offices, so I went to the Beatles LOVE box office and plunked down $140 for a fairly standard ticket (I was in the back but as other people have mentioned it doesn\'t really matter where you sit because the auditorium is designed well and you can see pretty well from any seat).\nSo the show starts, and after the first number that lasted about 3 minutes, an announcer announced over the speaker system that there would be a temporary interruption or something. I thought it might be part of the show. They started playing some non Beatles muzak while everyone just kind of glanced around wondering what was going on. After 10 minutes I knew this wasn\'t part of the act. By the 15 minute mark people were getting up and walking out. At the 20 minute mark (I\'m pretty sure that\'s how long it was but I didn\'t time it with my watch), I had decided I\'d had enough also and was getting ready to leave...and then of of course the lights dimmed and the show picked up where it left off. I was a bit miffed that for the amount of money I spent on my ticket ($140 ain\'t cheap) that I had that experience. Once again, I told myself, venues can\'t get it right every time, so I bit my lip and stayed for the show.\nUnfortunately, my mood had been a little soured by the interruption. The rest of the show was pretty much as the other reviews have described. The dancers and performers obviously make the show. Their feats are unbelievable. If you think about just how difficult it must be for them to be pulling off what they do you can appreciate the show more. Most people can\'t lift their leg past their knee, and these people are trapeezing 40 feet in the air, flying all around each other, landing in car windows, stuff no human should be able to do but they seem to do it with ease. Very cool. \nAs for the music, it is good. They must have remastered all of the tunes because it sounds better than if the Fab 4 were down there doing their thing in person. Also very cool. Those two things are the only things that pull my review up to 4 stars, it otherwise would have been 3.\nSo, if I had to do it all over again, I wouldn\'t go unless I found discounted tickets. If you are a Beatles fan, you will of course love the music. Other than that it wasn\'t that amazing of an experience, but as I said, watching the Cirque was something else.', u'votes': {u'funny': 0, u'useful': 3, u'cool': 1}, u'stars': 4, u'sentiment': 0.13857052669552672}, {u'text': u'The wife and I recently went to celebrate our first anniversary. This was a great pick to mark that special occasion. The restaurant is a surprisingly small, intimate dining room with blue velvet booths (we scored one instead of a table), a stunning crystal chandelier, a nice grand piano in the corner being played throughout the evening, beautiful floral arrangements, waiters that bring food out like you\'ve seen in the movies, about what you\'d expect for what you spend there. Without going into boring details on everything, overall I would say if you can afford it and you enjoy fine cuisine, you probably can\'t go wrong here. If, however, you\'re like me and enjoy good food but aren\'t particularly well versed in fine French cuisine, you might want to save yourself a lot of money and go dine in one of Vegas\' many other excellent restaurants that are still pricey but don\'t even come close to Rubochon\'s prices. OK, that being said, I\'m going to describe each of the 16 courses I had with a brief commentary in case you\'re wondering what you might expect (I think they change it up nightly, so I wouldn\'t expect the same thing, but I\'m sure it\'s similar).\n\nFirst: L\'Asperge Blanche. White asparagus ""panna cotta"", fresh almonds and lemon grass. Review: awesome.\nSecond: La Tomate. Tomato with olive oil, basil, tomato gelee, topped with mozarella. Review: best friggin\' tomato you\'ll ever eat. They serve it like a sliced patty with the oil drenched inside of it.\nThird: Le Caviar. Thin couscous and Oscetra caviar, smooth cauliflower cream, green asparagus gelee. Review: I\'m not a huge fan of Caviar but this was pretty good and I\'m sure it would make a Caviar connesieur blush.\nFourth: L\'Euf. Egg yolk in baby spinach ravioli with morels. Review: like everything else, the portion served is tiny. This was I think a single ravioli (or maybe two) with a very exquisite sauce and interior. Of course, unlike any ravioli you\'ve probably ever tasted and pretty awesome.\nFifth: La Saint-Jacques. Scallops royal with chive emulsion and buckwheat tuile. Review: Incredible scallops. Best I\'ve had by far.\nSixth: Les Crustaces. Truffled langoustine ravioli with chopped cabbage, Sea urchin, potato puree with a hint of coffee, coral and ginger perfumed tea. Review: to be honest it\'s hard to remember each dish a week later from memory, I didn\'t take notes on each, although I think some people do this. The waiters didn\'t seem offended when I broke out the camera on a few occasions to snap pics of the entrees. If I remember correctly this was a pretty damn good ravioli.\nSeventh: Les Petits Pois. Light pea veloute with mint on top of a delicate sweet onion custard. Review: This was really zippy and good. My reviews are pretty Simpleton I know but I\'m really typing out the menu more for your enjoyment than thinking my reviews will leave you speechless.\nEighth: Le Thon. Smoked and seared Tuna, cauliflower, Nori and green curry. This one I remember well. Really amazing Tuna. Stunning even. \nNinth: I asked at the beginning of the meal for the Kobe beef. They said ""no problem, we\'ll give you whatever you\'d like."" So, here they substituted the Veal for the Kobe beef I asked for. It was of course real Kobe beef, and it was tender as can be and rich in flavor. I won\'t say it was the best cut of beef I\'ve ever had as I\'m a fan of great steakhouses, but this was serious beef and I can\'t say anything bad about it.\nTenth: Les Pousses de Soja. Soy beans cooked risotto style with lemon zests and coriander. A very small risotto that was nice after the heavier courses and was excellent. \nEleventh: Dessert time. L\'Acai. Red fruits granite, fresh raspberry and yogurt sorbet. A very pretty raspberry yogurt sorbet that was good, but not a total knockout. Beautiful presentation of course.\nTwelfth: Le Caramel. Caramel cremeux infused with Arabica, chocolate rice souffle. This was awesome. Even better though, the wife doesn\'t like fruity desserts, so she sent hers back. They were very apologetic and were not offended in the least. Shortly after, they brought out a dessert for her that could not have been any more to her liking. It was as if they knew everything about her. They brought her a fresh strawberry (I think it might have been in a light strawberry sauce), then poured white chocolate on it at the table. The strawberry dish was swirled in cotton candy, her favorite. She was, pardon me for saying so (and sadly not a result of my doing), orgasmic. Think of the Meg Ryan scene in ""When Harry met Sally."" That was her eating her dessert, and that scene, aptly captured on my new Flip camcorder, was worth the price of admission alone.

Mixed into the lemony, creamy, peppery risotto with peas it was divine.

At the time, the boy and I looked at the menu, looked at each other and promptly decided 'Valentines'. The menu had plenty options for meat, fish and vegetarian eaters alike, it was hard to pick really what I wanted to try first!\n\nFor Valentines itself, there was a set menu for 28 quid (3 courses). This little cafe/restaurant had their delivery down pat. Although clearly preprepared, the food was of such high quality you could forgive them for working round what is such a high turnover night for restaurants. The waiting staff (or at least the lady who served us) were discreet, and efficient, allowing us time between courses to pause but not to start to wander. \n\nTo the meal: as we sat down, my eye was immediately drawn to the table arrangement. Now, I don't normally comment, but on the table was a little tray of salt, pepper and oil with just the smallest dab of balsamic vinegar. It almost looked like a work of art in itself to match the flower arrangement and candle. \n\nAs it was Valentines day, I treated myself as the non driver of the night to a Valentines cocktail, a martini-based strawberry infused concoction, with (I swear) a hint of herb - basil? Might have imagined it, but it was a delicious aperitif to start the evening. I followed it up with a large glass of Nero D'Avolo, more of an acquired taste, which arrived the further I travelled down the glass. The boy tucked into a rose prosecco, which was like a trail of bubbly lava going down the throat. \n\nTo the food - for starters, I had roasted Mediterranean vegetables with rocket while the boy had wild mushroom tart. I think this was the only time I felt a pang of regret for the preparation style as the vegetables were refrigerator-cold, where I expected them to be even a little warm still. Nonetheless, great texture, great flavour, and the mushroom tart tasted lovely as well, although the pastry was a little hard for the boys taste (re-warmed, we suspected). \n\nWe also tucked into warm rosemary foccacia (oh, so, so rosemary good, I haven't eaten bread this delicious in a while) and olives while we waited for our starter and took the opportunity to mop up olive soaked oil as well as the balsamic-dipped oil that had so caught my eye earlier. \n\nAnyway, back to the main course, where I had a beautifully cooked piece of salmon, resting on top of a spring onion potato cake (you know that goosebump feeling you get when you tuck into slowly cooked, caramelised onions - well, this one would have had you at your knees) and sauteed spinach surrounded by a lake of creamy herb sauce. The boy had ribeye steak in a green peppercorn sauce that in his words, melted in the mouth and he had never had a steak cooked so well. My my, strong words, but I believed him. A side of garlic foccacia bread had us stuffed to the gunnels, but in such a satisfied way.\n\nFinally, we both had the passionfruit sorbet as a light finish to a sumptious meal. I was expecting something sweet, but this sorbet was sharp as they come and super, super cold, having also been pre-prepared (frozen strawberries at the bottom were a giveaway). Doused with prosecco, it was a welcome accompaniment to the sharp sorbet.\n\nSo in summary, Zucca, you are sharp as they come.

Big buckets masquerading as wine glasses. \n\nBeing a Tuesday night, it wasn't particuarly busy read: dead when we arrived, but business was picking up by the time we left, so we had the place to ourselves. Food took a while to arrive, but what can you say when it is freshly cooked? \n\nIf you want a recommendation, then I strongly would suggest that you try the shaksuka - although the menu indicates it is lightly sauteed aubergine but really, it is chargrilled to an inch of it's life, releasing all that delicious smoky aubergine flavours that we know and love. Contrasted with a light dip and deliciously dressed onions, oh, I could have eaten it all day. Other starters sampled included the stuffed mushrooms, sauteed king prawns (with luscious plump roasted tomatoes) and the dana sogush. Not a single complaint arose from the table. I think some amongst our party might have tried to lick their plates clean. \n\nMains: I had the monkfish and prawns on tomato and olive sauce. Now, here I think Nargile fell down, as the tomato sauce was strongly at odds with the flavours of the monkfish and prawn (both beautifully cooked) - both good, but an unsuccessful match, I felt. I also snuck in some creamed spinach on the side, mainly because I love the stuff, and it didn't disappoint here. \n\nThe boy and the mother both ordered the Kuzu Kus Kus - a giant plate of cous cous and root vegetables delivered with a separate bowl of collapsing lamb on the bone and more vegetables. A success from both sides. The father tucked into a mammoth mixed kebab which he struggled to finish, such was the quantity of meat in front of him. But you have to try, don't you?\n\nFinally, although we were all groaning and trousers were a-popping, of course we had dessert. Baklava, the mallow surprise (?) and sorbet were delivered. For me and the father,  the baklava was nice but way too heavy on the almond flavours, that the 3 pieces were too much - one would have sufficed. The marshmallow dessert was a hit with the boy as was the sorbet with the mother. All washed down with fresh mint tea and a bottle of New Zealand wine (The Jive Pinot Noir, nom nom nom). \n\nNargile - I think you are great.

Oh, sweet lord, I almost turned to religion in my ecstasy over the common tomato soup, because DB has it down pat - I've never tasted such a refreshing, taste-bomb of a bowl. when you add the ravioli to the mix, the heady smoky flavour (think Belhaven smokery, if you know it... if not, well, it's really strong in the smoky department) of the mushroom made it a powerful companion. \n\nThe Silent Reviewer's roasted veg on brioche was... dull by comparison, and there was no way we could see a way to make it sound more exciting than it was. Every bite he took, the envy on his face grew, with a hint of regret for not going with the same as me. \n\nFor the mains, I had the rice pancake with spiced-up chickpeas, cauliflower and cashews (all the c's really did sound inspiring). What I thought was going to be relatively light turned out to be a dense heavy stodgy pancake with a clumsily spiced stuffed - it was alright, but to be honest, it wasn't well executed or a memorable dish.\n\nThe Silent Reviewer had the chili filo tart stuffed with butter and kidney beans.

And it tasted like it was... another dish of forgettable value - for me the best bit was the swede chunky chips - they were delicious, but the SR just looked depressed. \n\nWe finished up sharing the lemon and raspberry posset (which I had the last time... amazeballs again) and the vanilla and orange cheesecake. Once I slowed down enough, I realised that the cheesecake was absolutely fabulous in a rather muted way. \n\nNow, when I say muted, it is because throughout the meal, I had felt more and more rushed. Several times we had to turn the waitress away as we were asked yet again for drinks and menu orders. When ordering the soup we were warned it would take ten mins to prepare. Ten mins? I would assume it would take ten mins for my starter to be prepped anyway, why should that be seen as slow? But that was only a precursor to what happened next. Main course turned up almost as soon as our starters were cleared. Dessert order taken and promptly arrived within minutes. I literally had to pick up my spoon to make like I was still eating in order to keep the overeager staff at bay (this was where I stubbornly slowed down and realised, actually my dessert was pretty good) as I caught out of the corner of my eye the waitress charging towards our table again. I felt rushed, that I ate too fast and ultimately didn't really enjoy the experience. Except for the soup - everything is forgiven for that. \n\nBy the time we were back in the car, it had just turned 9pm. We were seated for 7:30pm - and in that time had knocked back a 3 course meal. I had barely reached half a glass of wine by dessert (seriously, that would normally be a bottle and me eyeing up the liqueur menu).

Wow, this is a popular place, I thought!\n\nSo we turned up, starving and excited, on a wet and miserable night to a near-empty restaurant. I could see that multiple tables had the Thali experience menu on the table and realised that the restaurant wasn't fully booked per se, but clearly they were limiting what time and when groupon vouchers could be used. Hmmm. Fine. \n\nThe thali menu itself was six choices - if you were vegetarian, you had to like paneer, as there was no other choice, although there were four options to choose from (from memory) - Sukutha (my choice), spinach sensation, tikka or something else - essentially a sauce with the meat of your choice (or cheese). Other options were butter chicken or a lamb dish. Side dishes that came with the thali were not explained and bread wasn't included unlike some other places I have visited. \n\nSo once we had time to order, we waited for our half pint of Cobra to appear.

We were served our main after 9pm. Now, that would be fine if this was freshly cooked, but clearly each dish came from a larger vat of food, so why it took so long to deliver, I have no idea. We didn't get asked how our food was, and no more drinks were given. Other tables looked equally forlorn.

It was full to the brim and just seemed that the acoustics were nicely setup to cause a constant sound of bedlam. I literally couldn't hear half of what the SR was saying, and we lapsed into silence for most of the meal. It felt rushed, with someone coming past our table every few minutes, asking us for an order, or delivering up food. For drinks, I had a very average Merlot (only two reds for sale by the glass, so options limited), and the boy knocked back a couple of lemonades. \n\nThe boy and I shared fish cakes and popia. The popia were nicely stuffed, more filling than batter, and the fish cakes were pleasant. We followed this up with duck with choo chi and pad prig ti dumm (monkfish, king prawns and scallops). I had thrown caution to the wind and gone for one of the pricier options on the menu, but the lightly spiced monkfish sounded too delicious. \n\nAnd this was where the problem was, it wasn't delicious. It was nice. It wasn't spicy - flavoursome and nicely cooked (scallops were pretty close to tender), yes, but not spicy and the flavours, well, they just weren't very elegant or interesting. The SR seemed to enjoy his duck, but in the same, deflated, 'oh, is that it?' kind of way. My dish also had some random squid that I didn't really want in there as well. We had ordered some pad mee on the side - which had the consistency of super noodles - and some roti. The more I ate, the more I realised I didn't want to. When the waiter came round to start emptying our table i.e. push all the remaining noodles onto our plates - I said no. I also don't like having someone else serving food onto my plate. So instead, all the food was heaped onto the SR's plate. It didn't exactly give me the option to return for more noodles later.\n\nOverall, it felt rushed and we didn't really enjoy our meals.

Service - too hassled and rushed - by the time the main course arrived my stomach was in knots and I was feeling pretty anxious - not relaxed at all. Surroundings are way way way too noisy - need to seriously dampen acoustics in there - and price was seriously excessive of quality. In all honesty, I think this is the first Thai restaurant I've visited where I've been disappointed, and that's a shame - I can't think of a point where Dusit really scored well, bar some well cooked scallops and that really isn't enough to inspire me to return."", u'votes': {u'funny': 0, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 2}, u'stars': 2, u'sentiment': 0.194031746031746}, {u'text': u""I've glanced at Fishers so many times, but the menu has never really leapt out at me, until tonight.

It's just not a 5, but it's awfully close to a 4. \n\nFirstly, for a group of 13, we were a little large for their small dining area, and split across two tables - originally, despite being requested to have the tables close together, we were placed on two tables along a wall which meant that mixing together would have been awkward. However, they did resolve that and placed one group of us (myself included) in the middle, so mixing across was easier, and less intrusive for other tables. Having the door open was also a little offputting for this recovering smoker as the smell of tobacco wafted in from outside - its been a while since I mixed nicotine and food and whereas it was fine 4 years ago, it's not so much now. \n\nI didn't always feel that service was always that attentive (i may have annoyed one waitress by asking for a spoon a little prematurely)_ - my starter took a little longer to come out and the waitress who was primarily serving our table seemed to off chatting to someone else, leaving me confused while everyone else tucked in until eventually another lady appeared with my dish. Bread baskets were taken away without checking to see if we didn't want any more, and a glass of wine put in front of me without checking if I wanted any (as the DD, I didn't). Kudos though - the ladies serving us did replace cutlery pretty prompty without checking (shame of me for assuming not as our other table had cutlery for starters when we had not). \n\nBut my starter, that was superb. Sesame halloumi grilled and served with broad bean houmous and pea shoot salad. Now, this was a set of flavours that all worked independently as well as together. I loved every, single, delicious bite. If I could have a recipe for that creamy houmous, I would eat it every day. \n\nOthers varied in terms of how much they enjoyed their starters - the soup didn't seem to be as well enjoyed (tomato and basil). I think I picked the star of the show last night. \n\nAnd to be honest, it remained the star. I had the red gurnard, with crayfish couscous and sea greens but sadly, it was a little more forgettable. I could have sworn it had some sort of chilli sauce but the chilli was barely evident, and pretty bland. The sea greens seemed to be overwhelmed in butter, with any flavour lost as a result. The crayfish cous cous was pleasant but not a showstealer like the houmous. Again, combining the flavours was very nice, but in this case, individually less impressive. As for the red gurnard (a first for me), i didn't feel it had any impressive flavour, but it was cooked nicely and had a nice meaty feel to them. \n\nThe summer pudding seemed to be a disappointment to those who tried it, but can't comment on that myself, I was busy being jazzed up on rocket fuel coffee that had me awake til about 5 this morning. Note to self - can't drink coffee in the evening any more...\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my meal, not sure I would rave over The Shore though, although they are more than welcome to bribe me in broad bean houmous (did I mention it enough yet?).

Visited here with a bunch of Yelpers to check out the menu - opting for the starter/main combo but secretly wishing for dessert too. It all looked so good! \n\nThe starter was North African aubergine on a flatbread with an egg salad. There was a delicious but overpowering garlic and herb dressing - so good, but I was a little nervous directing comments to anyone who hadn't partaken in the dish themselves. From there, I decided to fly against the common choice of coley and puy lentils (so jealous when I saw it being served up, massive fillets anda solid helping of lentils... what more can you ask for? Unless you went for the short ribs and were given the bone of a teenage cow) and went instead for the thai rice cakes in coconut milk. The cocnut milk was a thai curry style, with massive pieces of lemongrass and lime leaves floating through it. Definitely a good winter warmer! However, I felt the rice cakes themselves were rather bland - strange (not unappealing) consistency of breadcrumbed chewy rice and herb patties - and definitely didn't contribute anything to the otherwise colourful dish. \n\nThe restaurant itself is casual, and heaving. There were people coming through the doors constantly throughout the evening. I loved the pictures up around the walls, couldn't stop staring at them and kept getting distracted despite the entertaining conversations around me - the calmness of the nautical images kept drawing me back in. There were some long waits between courses, and i did think once we finished our main, oh lordy, it's going to be a while til the guys get their desserts - but the conversation kept us going. I guess that is the price you pay for good food and a frighteningly busy restaurant! Nonetheless, the staff were great and even apologised when they delivered my drink with my meal (I ordered late)... I hadn't even realised it hadn't appeared. \n\nI also remained envious that I didn't go for dessert when it appeared, both compadres opted for the baked stuffed apple - apparently it tasted like Christmas - bah humbug!

On my second trip, the same issue I had taken from my first, was repeated once more. Service remains good, even when the restaurant is busy, but other parts of the business disappoint. \n\nThis time, we returned for the Scottish Menu, in celebration of St Andrews Day. The starter was a collection of treats including marag gheal (white pudding), venison (or vegetarian) haggis, cullen skink and grilled mussels with (scottish) cheddar. All in all, I thought the starter was a hit, with the highlight being the cullen skink. Everything was well flavoured and delicious. \n\nFor our mains, the boy had the beef and oyster pie. Turns out it was a singular oyster. For me, I had the kale and crowdie bridie - in effect, a cheese and kale pasty, delivered on a mustard sauce - the sauce was seriously mustardy and unpleasant - and given the bridie sat on said sauce, not much escaping it. \n\nOn the side, clapshot (swede and potato mash), burnt onions and stovies (lamb and potato). Obviously no lamb and potato for the dining vegetarian, and no replacement either, which I felt a little cheated over - after all, I still paid for my uneaten portion of stovies. \n\nIt's a small gripe, but extends a little further - the menu was printed without really paying attention to the vegetarians amongst us - the starter section didn't indicate it was a collection of starters (the boy only wanted soup... but did enjoy the overall selection) and didn't indicate any vegetarian alternatives. The mains, well to be honest, a pasty is a pasty, and I could have bought very similar out of a bakery for a fraction of the cost. The sides - well, I had clapshot and the onions, which was more of a garnish than anything else. The boy's pie looked very lonely, and his skirlie untouched (oats with added bacon in this case). Lamb stovies went down a little better. \n\nAnother gripe I have is timing. While I appreciate starters and mains appear to be freshly prepared, it takes a long time, especially on a busy night. The wait between starter and main reached painful proportions - I don't believe it shold take that long - but it felt that perhaps preparation didn't start til after we had finished our first course. \n\nThe medley of desserts - I didn't really feel there was much to say - echlefechan tart crust was rock hard, with flavours not to my taste; cranachan was pleasant enough. Clootie dumpling and sherry trifle - I just don't like either, and First Coast's version didn't convince me to change my mind. \n\nSo overall, I think First Coast has less promise than I hoped, downgraded as a result.

Imagine the lockin fun with that!), the seriously over the top wine tasting room with custom built tasting station (and very bad fake stone wall paper). \n\nAnd that brings me to the parts that make me cringe - the fake stone wallpaper took a rather funky tasting room (next door to cellars I would dream of owning) and added a layer of crass. The chandelier made out of nasty looking wine glasses just further contributed... and the mural of Burke and Hare in the function room was just seriously awful. If those were accidentally burned in a freak accident, I wouldn't miss them. That would leave the much better parts of Hotel du Vin, including the super lovely staff (Nan the manageress and Seb... a fantastic speaker, raconteur and sommelier) to do nothing but impress."", u'votes': {u'funny': 1, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 1}, u'stars': 4, u'sentiment': 0.0847549019607843}, {u'text': u""I dunno, I am struggling here.

When I arrived, LL's was heaving - and this was after the lunchtime rush and heading into high tea season. \n\nWe both ordered the soup of the day - leek and potato with a hunk of fresh wholemeal bread. Extremely underseasoned, but once brought up to my tastebuds approval, it was pleasant enough. I washed it down with a small pot of detox tea - a small pot that barely provided two cups for four quid. Detox tea - interesting flavour, had me craving a slice of apple to throw into the mix. \n\nFinally, we both went for a slice of cake - he had the Victoria sponge, I had the lemon poppyseed. The lemon cake was overpowering with lemon flavouring frmo the half inch thick icing. I can't believe I am saying this but in this particular cake's case - less really should have been more. A large chunk of cake, all too sparing on the poppyseed and too much lemon left me less than impressed. The Victoria sponge was much better - a lighter sponge but still a heavy hand with the icing. With slices as generous as here, it is a little too much for one to eat on their own. These are cakes that belong in a dollshouse but in reality just are too much too handle.\n\nThe boy also had a hot chocolate - apparently amazing, if you like your chocolate molten and with marshmallows and Flake. \n\nThe waitresses also do a pretty good job of canvassing the area to keep an eye on their customers.\n\nAll this for 26 quid. \n\nI gotta say - I begrudged it for soup and cake. The atmosphere was busy busy busy and customers are crammed in where possible - doesn't make for a comfortable dining experience.

It was always the place I recommended to friends looking for good Scottish cuisine and I've got nothing but fond memories. \n\nI've now recently visited both Dublin Street and St Mary's St locations and I have to say, I'm left wanting more. I had a thoroughly pleasant evening last night, the restaurant is very pretty in a Georgian manner, I think the prices are reasonable and the meal is fine, but distinctly unmemorable. I found the menu repetitive - vegetarian options all featured brocolli (which I am allergic to) and the dish I chose also arrived with a slightly yellowed sprig to garnish my dish. Beetroot was also quite a feature (I like beetroot, we are all good on that front). \n\nFor starters, I had the sea trout cured in vodka and beetroot, served with beetroot and red amaranth. The  sea trout carried barely any flavour but was a stunning deep red colour and overall the plate looked impressive, but the beetroot itself was the over riding flavour, drowning out the cured trout and the lemon mustard dressing was entirely forgettable. My dad tucked into some moist looking duck and was most happy with it. \n\nFor the mains, I had 10 (or 5?) spice salmon, with dill mash and beans (and a surprise guest - brocolli). Again, it looked pretty, and this time, although none of the flavours were particularly amazing on their own, combined with the citrus and chilli creme fraiche (not spicy), came together nicely. My mother enjoyed her lamb casserole and my dad was impressed with his pork dish. \n\nFinally, we finished off with the autumn brioche (dad loved it, I found it a bit too heavy on the spice for me, something didn't taste right) and marscapone panne cotta - the blackcurrant ice cream was delicious, the panne cotta bland and for me, there wasn't enough of contrast in flavours to enhance either. \n\nOverall, I think Stac Polly still does a lot right, but their menu doesn't excite me, or move me in particular. There are lots of small things which makes me think that it falls short of being impressive and simply remains at 'nice', where once I would demand Stac Polly for any monumental occasion, I think now, it sits nicely in there as a pleasant, middle of the road restaurant that hasn't reached the heights of fine dining, but is definitely of a better class than most, but it needs a bit of a push to make it a place I would aspire to go to."", u'votes': {u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 1}, u'stars': 3, u'sentiment': 0.28110670194003523}, {u'text': u""With enough wood inside to terrify a forest, Dagda  encourages you to drink locally and cozy on up.

I had the prawn puri, a nice touch in that you could see what ingredients were involved whereas in some restaurants it's a smooth sauce with an odd colour to it (not that the colour detracts), and it was a generous portion of prawns inside the puri. The Silent Reviewer had the mixed kebabs, which he greatly enjoyed. \n\nMy main was a huge selection of tandoori vegetables - with a little kick at the end. I don't usually pick the tandoori option, but I didn't feel particularly overawed by the vegetables - grilled vegetables are lovely, but the marinade hadn't infused the vegetables, just sort of slid into any nook or cranny available (bit hard on a tomato).

Attentive, friendly and pleasant. Food,well, I couldn't decide - mezze, main or platter? We saw the meat platter being delivered... presentation wise it looked fantastic and I wanted the veggie one... cept the silent reviewer did insist on wanting to consume some form of flesh, so with a tender craving for halloumi, I went for the vegetarian souvlaki whilst he plumped for the swordfish.

So, not overly won on the first course, but putting it down to wrong menu choice rather than bad food. \n\nNext up - the souvlaki and the swordfish. The souvlaki contained about an udders worth of halloumi - more than I think it is possible to consume - very salty halloumi as well - I found myself trying to bury the salt with the chips... or anything to combat the saltiness. Personally, I would have liked about half the halloumi and more veg - it felt very unbalanced. The chips, I also felt, were too oily and soggy, but I couldn't decide if that was down to the kebabs lying on top of the chips, or if there had been more oil drizzled on top. The salad was also oily (and tasty), which with the combination of the souvlaki (oily) and chips (oily) gave me an overdose of oil and by the end, it was too much for me. That healthy goodness that I had wanted from my meal was lost. \n\nSo, do I think what I had was good? Well, it was nice, and cooked well, but not inspiring to me. Flavours didn't overwhelm me.

Beautifully presented, nonetheless. \n\nThe boy also had the tarte tatin for dessert - with a 20 min wait, it was well worth it by the way it disappeared without giving me a single bite. He did allow me to try a small morsel of some fabulous vanilla ice cream though. \n\nWhat went wrong? Three attempts to find a wine in stock. Unfortunate, a little annoying, but we did end up with a nice Californian chardonnay as a result. \n\nThe boy also found his main was cold on the edges. Mine was roasting hot, so suspect one had to wait for the other. Otherwise, he loved his main course - dramatic as beetroot smeared its way all over the plate - a foodie bloodbath!\n\nLastly, I had a panic over my main course. The first dud of the night was finding broccoli in the dish - it wasn't mentioned, it makes me throw up (literally, not a metaphor for 'I don't like it'), I don't like finding it in my meals and request it to not be when I am aware of it. But it was all through my garnish, as was beetroot and carrot (apparently it was an experiemnt). What made it worse, was biting into something that had the consistency and saltiness of bacon (turns out it was a crispy spinach which was the guilty party, hard to imagine, but true). In the romantic dim candlelight, it looked like there was ham or bacon in the dish (beetroot infused carrot, eh!). In my defence, the boy tested and agreed that it tasted like bacon. Anyhow, it was enough to ruin the enjoyment of my meal. As for the ravioli, despite the three (quite different) flavours, the ultime result was bland and disappointing. So overall, I regretted my choice of main. \n\nFinally - the cheese platter I ordered was a little less than spectacular. Not bad... just indifferent. But the oatcakes were fantastic! For a girl who avoided oat cakes like the plague until this year, I've come to appreciate a good, home made oatcake. Three types, with the middle one tasting like a savoury hob nob. That may not seem like the highest of compliments, but for me it is. \n\nFinally, before you cast The Grain Store aside, think on this: despite previous reviews noting poor service, we didn't have that experience. Our servers were cordial and ticked all the boxes. They placed us away from the family with a young kid to give us privacy & peace in our very own dining area, and chatted away (and also recommended other places to visit). When I complained about my main potentially being soured by meat, not only did they doublecheck with the kitchen, but came back with an explanation as well as noted that they had provided feedback to the chef in regards to ensuring no meat like flavours are imparted in a veggie dish, so this would be noted as part of the meal, also offering to replace if I so wanted. Prompt with each part of the meal as well as the cheque, I found it exemplary. \n\nAs a date night, as I mentioned at the start of my review, it was a fantastic choice - if we found ourselves here again, I wouldn't be sad. I'd just be a little more judicious with my menu choices."", u'votes': {u'funny': 1, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 1}, u'stars': 4, u'sentiment': 0.07677248677248677}, {u'text': u""I hate to admit it but I really am a sucker for a theme pub.

If there is a corner untouched, you'll probably find another platform launched into it. There are platforms that start halfway down other platforms. There are platforms within platforms. \n\nWith all of the construction work currently underway to improve the station, the labyrinthine properties of Waverley get even more confusing. I am pretty sure that the numbering sequence took place while the number manager (OK I made that one up, can you tell?) was high on mushrooms. It feels like a lifetime walking from one part to another, but as I learned recently, those lifetimes tend to take under a minute, it just feels longer. There definitely feels like there is a drive to modernise this station, but there are curious anachronisms in this intent. Every platform has a gaggle of inspectors - even at the automated gates, you can avoid mixing with technology and have your ticket checked (for the gazillionth time) by a human being. Whereas in London, where it's a 'no ticket no travel' ethos, Edinburgh gives you a break, and allows you to purchase a ticket at any point on your trip. I like that. \n\n*CUE WHINGE*\nPlatform announcements for changes are announced not by tannoy, but by an inspector charging up and down the platform.

Don't ask me to repeat this, as it was hard enough the first time. \n\nFinally my order was taken. I went for the set lunch menu of nigiri, maki and miso with a green tea. I was craving miso on such a wintery day and figured that the rest of the meal would work, even if it did involve cucumber rolls, which to me is always a copout in sushi (it's a personal thing - it just doesn't have any flavour to me). I did throw in some spicy tuna rolls as well as I was hungry and figured on skipping the cucumber rolls. \n\nFor the first time in any Japanese restaurant, I was given one cup of tea, no pot. Given that I never saw the waitress again til I got the bill, I ended up being rather thirsty (note this is a tiny restaurant).\n\nFirst up was the spicy tuna rolls. It smelled rather strongly but tasted ok. Spicy, but not a huge amount of flavour. I did like the texture of the rice though. Next up was the chef's selection of nigiri which involved two pieces of squid - I'll put my hands up right now and say I didn't eat it. Tried it once, nearly choked, never again. I'm a safe sushi eater (tuna, salmon, eel and fish roe), and I am ok with that. Saying that, I thought it was a nice touch to include all varieties of fish in the selection so that the more adventurous get something with more bite. There was also some less than fresh looking tuna (I get it, it isn't native to here so going to be defrosted, but it looked really sad to me), salmon and egg. The cucumber rolls were overpoweringly doused in wasabi. The salmon rolls were ok, but not a lot of flavour. \n\nYou might wonder where my miso description went to, but it goes in last as that is when it turned up - after I reminded the waitress.

Out of 4 (of a block of 6). I'm probably not going back for my last 2. Bristo Yoga does get a 3rd star because I did enjoy the '1' of my 1.5 class, but the rest of it ends in an 'eh'. \n\nOn the first day of class, I turn up 20mins early (eager beaver) but due to some seriously poor directions and map, myself and 6 other students end up in the wrong place - turns out there are two St Columba's up by the Castle... and we were at the wrong one. Arriving 20mins late meant a mild rebuke from the teacher, initially offered no changing area (but then suggested that I could creep over to the bathroom), no warm up, a rushed yoga session (I did ask for the teacher to slow down at one point), and I hurt my neck trying to rush a shoulder stand. I walked out feeling stressed and angry... and really not feeling the benefit that normally comes with such a class. After wards, I felt mutinous more than anything and not really in the mood to return. \n\nNow, as a gesture, Bristo did offer an apology and a free drop in class. So that was nice. \n\nI made myself return for week 2 - that was a very different experience from the first. The session was smoother, the positions more clearly explained, and I didn't walk out in a pissy mood, so I felt in a much more positive position about the class. Hurrah! The only downside was when asked for injuries, I noted I had bad knees only to be brushed off with a comment along the lines of 'oh well, don't we all'. Right, everyone's smashed their legs up in motorcycle accidents? Of course, silly me... I would have preferred possibly a less cursory response.\n\nWeek 3 was a washout as I was ill. \n\nWeek 4, I had the day off. That meant in order to come to class, I was going to have to travel for a solid hour in order to get there in time. It was, in fact 90 mins, with another 30mins prep time. 2 hours, in total as Lothian Transports estimates were completely messed up. A bus expected to arrive a good clear 30mins early, meant that I arrived instead 30mins late and have hmmm... 5mins to run from George Street, up to Johnson Terrace. I made it to the venue, 3-4mins past the start of the class. When ringing the doorbell, there was no answer. I rang a couple of times, before another girl joined me. After the third, failed attempt, I decided, time to go hit up the pub. For you see, it was my birthday, and I figured, do I want to spend more time being upset outside of a yoga class, or should I just go and enjoy the remainder of my evening? Given that I had given up the opportunity to spend the beginning of my 33rd year with my family in order to go to my yoga class, traveled for so long and to be felled at the last (well, 4) minute, just brought it to a head for me. So I embraced the unhealthy option of a couple of rum and cokes at Banshee Labyrinth waiting for the Silent Reviewer to show up. \n\nThe fact that St Columba's is a pain in the ass to access (ring a bell, wait a good 5mins for the teacher to climb a couple of floors to open the door, this may take a few attempts) and the zero tolerance on tardiness leaves me just... disappointed and disheartened. Although I appreciate that late attendees can have a minor impact on a yoga class, in previous experience it hasn't been that big a deal - and until Lothian Transport smarten up their act, I don't feel confident that I can always make it to a location in time. I had heard so many good things about Bristo Yoga, but in reality, I didn't experience the warm and fuzzies when I went to class, week 1 made me feel as unwelcome as rotten fish in a fridge and week 2 whilst an improvement, didn't have me in the land of friendliness.

Really, I think this place deserves 3.5 stars - definitely not a 3 but not ready for a 4 yet. But I want to give it positive vibes, as I think that the Birdcage is a fab addition to Musselburgh. If you can find it, that is. Be warned, it's off the main drag, in a semi-industrial estate (it's a converted cotton mill) and in the dark, an absolute bugger to find (first road on the left by the job centre, folks). I had all but given up when I saw my friend run out of her car, so followed her into a pedestrian quadrant where the Birdcage sat. \n\nIt's a very modern bar and restaurant, serving pretty modern dishes that are really rather unheard of in this town. Balsamic roasted beetroot with goats cheese and rocket salad? How on earth does that fit in with the local chippy? I don't think it does, but really, honestly and truly not a bad thing. Sadly, said salad didn't have the flavour I was expecting, the beetroot and rocket both overpowered by the cheese, and the vinegar didn't carry over any flavour at all, so I was a little disappointed, although overall it was a pleasant salad. \n\nMy main was a gnocchi (home made by the looks of it) with wild mushroom, drizzled with truffle oil. A little greasy for my liking, but I find mushroom dishes to be generally more greasy, so you can take that comment with a pinch of salt. My friend's angus burger and chips looked fabulous, and meaty (both chips and burger). \n\nWe both went all out with dessert - chocolate fondant for her, and sticky toffee pudding for me. Not something I normally order, but damn, the flavours were outstanding, with toffee and cinammon screaming out. Sponge itself was a little dry. \n\nSo you can probably see why this is a 3.5 star. Although the food was good, it wasn't amazing or hit the level of sophistication that this place is striving for. However, I don't want Birdcage to fail - perhaps, as it hasn't been open too long, it just needs to stretch its wings out a little more and will improve in time.

So we shared a vegetarian anti-pasti mix of roasted vegetables, smoked mozzarella and olives and made way for pizza. \n\nWhile we dined on our starter, the waiter gave us samples of polenta bites (a little under seasoned for me) and some bread, after over hearing me ask the boy if he wanted any. No charge for either - just a nice little touch. \n\nMy calzone arrived - I have to admit, I wasn't wowed, but the boy liked his pizza. Mine was underseasoned again and missing the raisins listed on the menu, and the pizza base was extremely tough and drenched with oil. It wasn't bad food, but it didn't blow my socks off either. \n\nFinally, because i had had a bad day, I went for a slice of tiramisu, to make everything a little better again. I definitely enjoyed the tiramisu, and it disappeared in seconds. \n\nAt the end, when we paid our bill, we were given one meal free (as part of some offer we didn't know about), and a loyalty card. I have to hand it to Cacio Pepe, they have their service down - pretty discreet, and everything was delivered as necessary. Prices are pretty reasonable, even without the deal. I would say Cacio Pepe is a rather nice place to spend a meal without it burning a hole in your pocket, but the price does match the quality - which is definitely reasonable, just not amazing."", u'votes': {u'funny': 1, u'useful': 4, u'cool': 2}, u'stars': 3, u'sentiment': 0.07216880341880341}, {u'text': u""B&Q at Hermiston Gate was where the madness started.

But there are places where you do have to just doff your cap in admiration - and Mark Greenaway is one of them. This restaurant is a 5 star... and more. \n\nGiven my reluctance to try out restaurants which may break my monthly salary, Yelp Eats was the perfect introduction to MG. The quality of food, service and overall dining experience was simply superb. The service was flawless. The plateware was gorgeous, as were the wine glasses. The dining room itself muted and understated in a modern/trad style. Loved the music. I hadn't even reached the food at this point. \n\nFirst up: an amuse bouche of pea and mint *frothy soup* (sorry, I can't remember the more refined term for this...spuma?) which, if I am honest, was the best part of the meal and made me sorely regret that I didn't opt for the pea and mint risotto for my main. It definitely was a tastebud tickler. \n\nThis was followed by a graciously selected slice of white rustic bread (I love good bread, so had to note it's attendence) and delivery of the mixed seafood raviolo in a langoustine broth with avruga caviar. Frankly just saying that adds a few notches to my culinary repetoire, let alone the opportunity to eat it. The presentation in a lidded deep dish added a lovely element of surprise, digging through langoustine-infused foam to reach the surprisingly large raviolo nesting on wilted greens below. The flavour of the raviolo was perhaps a little too delicate for my tastes, but the broth was lovely. \n\nFor the main, I chose, based on Jenny l.'s enthusiastic description, the skate wing, and foresaking my previous intent on the risotto. Lets be honest here, if I had had it my way, I would have had both, but sometimes life doesn't play that way. I wasn't a super fan of the beetroot puree, but the skate-wing simply dissolved away during consumption, and the olive mash was equally melt in the mouth,. The squid, which can be touch and go for me, was one of the last items on the plate along with the mash - which for me means it was the best. The beetroot crisps were an odd but pleasant sensation - wafer, melting and not what I think of when I think of beetroot. \n\nMy mum also had the ham hough, which she tucked into with gusto. Both my parents had the 11 hr slow cooked pork which was reportedly delicious and non-greasy. The spiced fillet accompaniment was also a hit. \n\nI have to make note as well of the presentation - each dish presented was a work of art. A feast for the eyes, the nose, the mouth. In the end, we opted to pay extra for a dessert, and to make this meal last a little longer. To the table, 2 dishes of bramley apple 6 ways and one cheese plate. The apple sorbet was a revelation and a new found love. Apple crisps and puree were a lovely contrast in flavour, but the jelly was instantly forgettable for both myself and my mother. My dad enjoyed the cheeses, although the goats cheese delivered a kick worthy of a hind leg. \n\nOverall, with the wine and dessert, we spent far more than what the Yelp Eats menu offered, but oh, what a way to go.

But, it's a new menu, and I think it needs to get of it's training wheels. Flavours-wise don't feel quite together yet. Presentation, as always, flawless. Service struggled with a table of 18, but was pleasant throughout, but time between courses was quite long, but I put that down to the sheer effort in presentation, however glasses were rarely empty (although my other half did observe as he didn't drink wine, he wasn't offered anything else to drink bar water). I came away with the same satisfied feeling as before and did have a fabulous evening, but perhaps with less wow involved. \n\nSo apart from time, the amuse bouche - celeriac (yum) and the flavour in the espuma packed a punch, but not quite sure red amaranth and a very surprisingly solid hazelnut matched in either flavour or texture. \n\nStarter: crab cannelloni and smoked cauliflower custard. Presentation was... just .... awesome. An inspirational dish. But... it was so cold there were ice crystals inside the cannelloni (which with the spinach butter acting as the pasta, it made sense to be so cold) which I didn't particularly enjoy. The display of releasing the applewood smoke and the flavours in the smoked cauliflower custard was fantastic and surpassed the cannelloni itself. \n\nFor my main, I went for the hake. I will note, which I hadn't noticed on my previous visit, that there is a major lack of vegetarian meals - starter, yes, but not main course, which I do find curious. In that manner, I am of course, biased. The hake was beautifully cooked, and I do recommend that the broth is added, it was delicious. The purple potato mash was the best item on the plate (with a nod to Bodger and Badger, I do love me some mashed potato) - the flavour in the potato were beautifully captured. I did notice that mashed potato was a popular theme in the dishes around me as well. Again, I am mesmerised by the detail in the dish in front of me. \n\nFinally, as I couldn't really say no (similar to last time really) to desert and this time, went for the broken lemon tart. That was a fun looking dish! It reminded my (looks-wise, not flavour) of Bassetts Liquorice Allsorts. The lemon tart pieces were fab, and shortbread base, packed full of buttery goodness. I *think* there was a lemon ice cream - that didn't really stand out for me, flavours were too close to the tart to be discernible - and coconut jelly, which to be honest, had attracted me to the dish in the first place - but it was utterly lacking in flavour - definitely felt like a dud. A week on though, the sharpness of the lemon tart sticks more in my mind. And I am not thinking about the fact I ate jelly for the first time in a long time (veggie no no, I am a bad girl as i didn't check for gelatine). \n\nAnyway, overall, if you went to MG for a beautifully presented meal, which is executed flawlessly, you won't be sorry.

We, unfortunately, didn't dress for the occasion, but thankfully were not turfed out for such insolence. \n\nNow, this review, being during the World Cup, will be a tale of two halves. \n\nFirst Half - Food\nOne of these days I'll return for the tasting menu, I think that will be fun times. \n\nFirst, we were presented with a drink - passionfruit and pomegranate I think, the waitress forgot to tell us, and we forgot to ask. It was lovely, nonetheless. It came with a selection of dips that could be matched with our starters - tomato and beetroot, spiced tomato chutney etc. They looked lovely, but I was so engrossed in the starter, I clean forgot to try them.\n\nFor starters, we split the vegetarian platter - it was a little awkward, as everything came out in 2's, but there was three of us. But, apart from that, the food itself, as my fellow diner commented, was a really refreshing change, with nary a deep fried dish in sight. Fried paneer with a spicy edge; a cake made of yam (for me, too soggy); spinach cake stuffed with figs (my favourite); and mushrooms, also stuffed and spiced (too spicy for me). \n\nNext up: mains. Chicken for the Silent Reviewer, South Indian prawn curry for the divine Ms M and for myself, baby aubergines. Again, the aubergine was a little too spicy for me, and my tastebuds died in a spice overload, but the prawn curry was lovely, creamy, and formed a tasty contrast to my dish. We also had the bread basket (I've had better naan elsewhere, but they were ok) and pilau rice. The portion sizes were good as well - not excessive, nor too small, that we all finished up satisfied. Dishes were not greasy either, another win for Mithas. \n\nOverall - food was lovely, well cooked (and cooked fresh, so you do have to wait) and nicely presented. Next time I'll have to ask to tone down the spice to make it more palatable for me, and that 4 stars will go up to 5. \n\nSecond Half - Drinks\nAlright, so we had had a couple of wines before entering, and if we hadn't, we probably would have been much more behaved on the drinks front, but boy, I'm glad that our inhibitions had been cast aside, because WE MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE (even if my head did hurt a little this morning). The Divine Ms M and I both opted for the cocktail sampling menu (poor, poor sober Silent Reviewer was our designated driver). This menu more than matched the food menu. Five cocktails for twenty pounds is an absolute steal as well, especially at this level of quality. \n\nStarting out with a watermelon and vodka aperitif (ginger, crushed watermelon and vodka) was a winning start. Every flavour was nicely balanced and outrageously good. It was then I met the love of my lift that evening ( a girl can have many, many loves of course) - hazelnut and sparkling wine - just hands down phenomenal - I would drink that forever. This was swiftly followed up with a Jack Daniels martini - from the coolness of watermelon and sweetness of hazelnut, it was a shock to the tastebuds, but a good one - the abrasiveness of the whisky tempered by the mixologist (involving pineapple) to a much more smooth level. Then onto the Red Salute - a fruitier, sweeter number with lychee that had been the original draw for me - but actually more forgettable than some of it's predecessors.

With a heaving restaurant last night, the whole place was heaving and there was a clear struggle to keep up. It took an age to get water to the table, and even longer to place drinks orders. the SR refused to order anything after the first drink was consumed - taking too long, he gave up the will to live. We had been asked to leave by 8 - which would have been fine as we started just after 6 - but we didn't get our meals until 7:45. I had to ask for a glass of water 3 times before I managed to get a drink; my sister didn't even get her main meal without having to call someone over to point out the empty space in front of her... drinks forgotton, drinks and food mis ordered, it all felt like much harder work than it should have been. At the end, we had an automatic service charge applied, despite the shambles of service. We didn't pay it. \n\nFood wise - it was as much as a fusion restaurant would be expected to muster - I don't think I've been to a place that calls itself fusion that has been really able to execute multiple cuisines effectively, and Bar Soba didn't impress. Steamed mushroom buns were flavourless, katsu curry underseasoned and too spicy for me (also didn't taste like any katsu curry I have ever had before). The fries and satay sauce however, was delicious. Teriyaki beef was simultaneously tough and undercooked. I'm perhaps being tougher in my review than I should - but the frustration of slow service infiltrated the whole experience to some extent. \n\nOn the other hand, their cocktails are pretty delicious. Those did go down a treat (bar the Chilli Shoulder, and Green Mean Tequila Machine) - personal favourite for me was the Aichee Martini. It was here that Bar Soba excelled - if they perhaps had more staff to work the bar, kitchen and floor, and focused on the cocktails and decent snacks, I would personally think that it would be long term a more successful venture. \n\nThe only other reason I've given this place a 2 star rather than a 1, is the lack of fight over disputing the bill at the end - after already having drinks (wrong ones and ones that never showed up) taken off the bill, it still felt insulting to fork out a service charge given the lack of it - but once pointed out, it was removed immediately. It's a saving grace, although only a small one. \n\nSo after my rather long whingy review, the summary would be - more cockatils please, more staff, forget the food, I'll come back - otherwise, I won't be bothering.

It didn't help especially when my hubby is picky about where he parks. [his mustang is his life] but this time he had no choice. Any parking spot would have to do. \n\nFinally getting inside we noticed people were waiting. We prayed th eline wouldn't be long. The hostess told us the wait would be 30 minutes and she told us to take a seat and it'd go by fast. The next people that came in we're told they could wait in the bar.. gee i wish they would have told us that, i could have used a couple drinks. next, another couple came in and were seated right away. My husband got up to ask why and the hostess announced that you can go online and be put on the waiting list. Good to know for future nights to chili's. That'll def save time and help my poor tummy from starving.\n\nOnce we were seated a nice good looking gentlemen came and asked if it was our first time there or if we were familiar with the menu or specials. We said we'd been there a few times but not in a while so he explained every thing clearly and even offered which drinks were the best tasting. \n\nI ordered a strawberry margarita, which i thought ended up being way too sweet and i always order strawberry margaritas when i go out. The hubby got a martini and another drink but i cant remember the name of that one. Food wise, he ordered the beef fajitas which he thought was delicious but not very much meat. Mostly veggies such as bell peppers. I ordered the fish taco's. They were very dry, but good. My favorite and his on our plates was the rice. So moist and fluffy.

I HATE WAITING. especially if the place isn't busy. \n\nQuick, friendly service. Lady explained to us the specials and what different words meant that i hadn't heard before. Add, 1 more star.\n\nDidn't try the chips, salsa or bean dip. I'm just not one to fill up on that stuff then take two bites of my food. No, i wanted to have a empty stomach for my meal so that i could write about my experience. [yes, i know im just brilliant, no need for the pat on the back]\n\nThe food came and it was hot. It was delicious, mostly cause i was starving.. but it wasn't something that was spectacular. My mother in law makes better beans and rice. The taco cracked as soon as i took a bite. Thats another pet peeve. Inside I cried a little.. Now all the meat cheese and lettuce was going to fall out. Well, that ruined my taco experience. Boo. The chile relleno was delish. Cooked to perfections and de-seeded, just the way I like it. Adding 1 more star just for the chile relleno. Overall it was good\n\nWould have given it another star but this place is way over priced. Can we say expensive. Especially because this place isn't on the strip. Their prices are the same as Gonzalez Y Gonzalez and they're portions aren't as big or as good.

Chang's and have never had a good experience..\n\nThey  say in life to never say never..\n\nCrap they were right. This P. F. Chang's experience was one for the kodak books.\n\nOriginally my husband and I were going to go to Claim Jumper for our anniversary but once there and stuck in the parking lot for more than 20 minutes looking for a parking spot, I was really annoyed. Taking a final look in the direction of the restaurant and seeing the line outside I decided to look for another place.\n\nWinner, winner, chicken dinner. P.F. Changs was in our sights.\n\nWalking in we asked how long it was for a booth because we had our one year old daughter with us. (no we didn't get a baby sitter). The hostess mentioned that the wait was 45 minutes to an hour long. WTF! Next, she said or we can opt for outside eating which was heated. No Wait?! Okay, im in. My tummy was growling and about to attack the next poor soul who walking in front of me. \n\nFinally at our seat outside, we took off our jackets cause the dang heaters were so hot. Our waiter was quick and friendly. His name was Brandon. I swear, he had our drinks within seconds, or so it seemed. \n\nHe filled us in on drinks and menu specials and even explained we could substitute for other items if we wanted for only a two dollar charge. We opted for his suggestion which was the 2 for $40 deal. \n\nThen we went for the upgrade for the chicken noodle soup for an extra two bucks. We asked for the soup to have no tomato's (im allergic) and no mushrooms (hubby and i both dislike them, yuck!). When It arrived it was so good. No joke, the BEST soup I've ever had. WELL, okay its tied with BJ's (they're broccoli and cheese soup). The noodles we're freaky, they looked clear but they were very tasty. Huge, but good. The cilantro inside was very fresh. it said it was chicken noodle soup but there was hardly and chicken. it didn't phase me though. We both had two bowls full and were going to have tons of leftovers. YAY!\n\nThe appetizer we got was the lettuce wraps. They offer the option for chicken or vegetarian. Meat, meat meat baby! They were good, but not mouthwatering. I was trying not to eat much of them because I still had two entree's on their way. My husband was into them, way more than me. I let him munch on them. \n\nOur entree's arrived, both with rice included. Cool. The first entree was orange peel chicken. It was drenched in orange sauce which really made the chicken kind of soggy. Not a huge fan. It was good (like the wraps) but not something I would come back for. If you paired the chicken with a bit or white rice it took away some of the sauce which made the dish better. The next entree was the honey shrimp. OMG, soo good. My husband and I were literally fighting over it, even though i ordered it. Letfovers? Nope, none. Damn :/ \n\nLastly the deal came with two shot sized desserts. My husband was no surprise when he ordered the NY cheesecake. He wasn't a big fan of it because the raspberry sauce on top was super sour and bitter. eek. I was torn between ordering the tiramisu and the thres leche lemon drop cake. Considering the fact that I always go for the tiramisu I decided to be different and get the lemon. When Brandon returned with my dessert he brought me both! :) He whispered for me not to rat him out and that he brought me both because he knew I couldn't decide. The tiramisu was very moist and delicious. It had a distinct coffee flavor. it was gone and two bites. The other, the lemon was so yummy! I love lemon and it was perfect. It was very lemony but at the same time very cakey. If that makes any sense. i dont know why it was called tres lech cause it wasnt very moist, it was more like a cookie. It had lots of cookie texture to it.\n\nOver all I was a huge fan of P F Changs and we will be returning next week. We were such fans that we asked to speak with the manager and left our waiter Brandon a great review.

It's called the spice market but overall lacked a good amount of spice. Kind of like an oxy moron if you ask me. \n\nFirst I would like to begin with the fact that when a friend and I went to the section that said salads, there were no salads. No lettuce, no croutons no dressing. In fact there was potato salad, crab salad, macaroni salad but nothing that remotely looked like a normal plain green salad. Annoying? Yeah just a bit. I call that false advertising. We had to walk to the other side of the buffet to get a salad. \n\nNext we headed over to the meat section. The prime rib was over cooked. The inside was grey. My husband like it but no one else in our party. I'm more of a medium rare type of girl with the inside a bright red. There were ton of other options as well. There was lamb but I didn't try it. Instead I opted for the mediterranean chicken they had which was shaped into little balls with a red coating and green spices. It was delicious an extremely tender. I was going to go for some fried chicken but it was too greasy an wa literally sitting in a inch of grease in the pan. No thanks.\n\nThen the next thing that caught my eye were these shrimp filled martini glasses. Adorable! Great eye catching presentation! Tasted good, but i dont know how anyone could mess up that anyway. \n\nStarting with my third plate I headed overto the warm crab leggs. It was nice to see them already prepared, cracked open and laying there. Super easy to eat and i loved them warm. Other buffets on the strip have them cold and i hate it. How hard is it to warm them?! The butter was in a cool and easy dripper that you could just grab a small coffee sized creamer cup and fill. The crab was okay, a little flavorless but i think it was because i got the last two crab legs in the pan. they would go so quickly that i had virtually no choice. There was already a line for the new pan so i thought what the hell, ill go for the last two, im tooooo hungry. They were good enough that I ate about 6 legs. Next on the plate I added some popcorn shrimp which was cooked to perfection. At other buffets i notice the popcorn shrimp becomes very mushy or soggy. No it was still crispy and full of flavor. It actually had some spice, hardy har har. \n\nMy last and final dish was desserts. Here was the best part of the night. They actually have a lady that does fresh crepes. I was able to pick out the filling and toppings. Wooo. Thats what im talking about baby. My husband went with bananas and i couldnt help but resist the apple. The lady made it in seconds and topped ti with fresh whip cream and drizzles chocolate allover it. holly hell was it delicious. the warmth of the dish made it melt in your mouth. im giving a star just for the crepe. After that I went back for the rasphberry cheesecake. Perfectly one bite it wasnt too sweet or bitter. It left you wanting more but perfectly satisfied. With just a tiny bit of room left, yes i had to remove my belt.. No judging please.. I went with the tiramissu bite sized cake. Tiramissu? eeek, not so much. Don get me wrong it was yumdeliumpcious but it tasted more like coffee cake. \n\nOverall the only thing which i enjoyed to the fullet was desssert.

Awesome. my dish was a make your own burger. It was huge. I ordered a chicken burger with bacon, cheese and grilled onions. Gosh it was so big i had enough for dinner that night.

Olives, tomatoes and lots of lettuce was the main part of the salad. it came with two small sides of ranch to pour ontop.

When we left, we knew we had found the perfect Dr for us. \n\nOver the course of the next few months, if I ever had an questions I could always call and they would have a nurse ask him or she would answer them herself.

He always gave extremely informative information and made the best decisions for me and my family. He thought the baby was going to come on the 25th, so we decided inducing was the best decision. He had me come to the hospital at 330pm and thought I wouldn\'t have the baby til the next day... well sadly (for him) he had to leave home at 1130pm (in the rain) and come deliver. It literally took only 5 pushes and she was out. he told me he couldn\'t believe how easy it was. \n\nIf you pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or pregnant and wanting to know your options (yes, an abortion or adoption) go see him.

It comes with onion rings or fries for next extra charge. Here's the kicker.. You can have half and half! Whoopy! Most places don't so that anymore and if they do they charge extra. I was so excited! The couple we dined with said I acted as if I won the lottery. Ha ha, meanie heads. Hey, I love my food what can I say. The onion rings tasted beer battered like the ones at yardhouse. \n\nThe children's menu is extremely affordable. I got my daughter the cheese quesadilla, which I thought came just with a drink for $3. But instead it came with a order of fries too, which I wasn't expecting. Awesome. \n\nMy husband loved his club sandwich. Which he said was huge and he could only eat half which if you know my husband is unheard of. Crazy talk I tell you. So, big portions are here as well.\n\nCustomer service was great. They were quick about giving us refills which we never had to ask for.

Maybe ten minutes. We requested for a booth, which is why we had a bit of a wait.\n\nMy husband and step dad headed to the bar to get a couple beers. Marzen was the name if I remember correctly.\n\nWe were seated towards the middle, with a waiter named Scott. He was very personable and friendly. He opened up to us about how our 2 year old daughter reminded him of his daughter who is 15 months. Instantly our daughter gravitated to him and his warm personality. He asked if we wanted something for her to munch on while we waited. YES! Please!\n\nWhile waiting to pick out our meals, Scott brought my daughter a big bowl of fruit filled with grapes, cantalope, melon, and pineapple. She loved it. Kept her entertained too.\n\nAfter looking at the large menu, we decided to start with an app, calamari. I loved it. YUM. It came with two sauces. A regular red marinara, and then a different tarter lemony, mustardy sauce. It was great. Very unusual. Never had that with calamari before.\n\nAs our meals, I ordered the lobster mac n cheese. ($20) It was very light, buttery and refreshing. There was plenty of lobster, in small bite sized pieces. Cooked to perfection. Ive had it in pasta before and always found it over cooked. The shrimp was delicious and a nice pair. It was usual because it came with bow tie pasta instead of the usual macaroni. A nice change. It was a good sized mount, but after eating a bit of the app i could only finish half. My step dad and husband had no problem finishing off the rest.\n\nMy step dad and husband got the steak. ($22) Dad got it with veggie and mash potatoes. Hubby got it with fruit and garlic fries. I certainly made sure to try a bit of everything they had. The mash potatoes were full of garlic and potato skins. YUCK, i hate skins. The garlic fries were very tasty and very well seasoned. The steak on both, were cooked to perfection. My step dads was medium rare and extremely tender. I made sure to go back for second bites on that. The veggies were a type of medley, of zucchini and carrots. I noticed the portions were a little smaller than i expected\n\nMy daughter got the mac n cheese with fruit and asked for an extra side, which was french fries. ($5) Scott had no problem giving us a second side for no extra charge. Sweet! Her mac n cheese tasted just like the kraft type, which is her favorite. French fries were medium sliced.\n\nAll the food came out piping hot which is a very nice change to some of the restaurant Ive been to before. I actually burned my tongue on my lobster/shrimp pasta. \n\nFor dessert we ordered, the apple cinnamon bread pudding with a scoop of vanilla ice cream AND their brownie and ice cream drizzled with carmel and chocolate sauce. Both were barely warm, almost cold but they were still really good. It took 20 minutes for our desserts, which was ridiculous. Thank goodness my daughter was preoccupied with crayons and the guys were busy with the football game on the tv. I'm sure they would have been the highlight of our meals had they been hot. The waiter Scoot apologized and took both desserts off our bill and said he was sorry everything took so long because the kitchen was backed up. \n\nother than a few bumps in the road the customer service was outstanding and the food was very good.

(at least for us it does! 3 adults and a toddler)\n\nThings I buy on the regular here..\n\n1. Philadelphia cream cheese. A huge tub of it for 7.99. The same amount at a store would be double that. I started buying it here because i was tired of getting 8oz for 2.99. \n\n2. The keurig K cups. $36 for 80. Thats cheaper than walmart. They have only two brands (San Francisco Bay AND donut hole). they do have others but theyre seasonal.\n\n3. laundry soap. 200 loads for $15 bucks. I seriously got tired of paying 9.99 for 70 loads. Of course its the good brand too. Not a knock off. Good bye stubborn stains. \n\n4. the samples! Want a little snack but dont want to go get lunch. Here they give samples of whatever they have. My toddler loves coming to get the snacks. this last week they have blueberry yogurt with flaxseed. She ate it all! Then we tried the stuffed spinach ravioli. Delicious! We bought a bag that would feed, 6? for $10. next they had granola bars for sample. They give a sample usually on every isle and it wont disappoint. It actually is really smart cause then you end up buying the product because its so good or you want to know what it tastes like before you buy it. Most stores dont do this. \n\n5. Th pharmacy and eye dept. Never seen a line at the pharmacy, which is a totally different story for CVS, They are very low priced for contacts and eye exams. You can even make an apt and they give out samples for contacts here too. My other eye doctor didnt.\n\nI will say, parking is horrid but considering how great the deals are then you know why.

This was already easing my mind into leaving her The third section was for 2 and up. They had video games and computers. Two flat screens with movies going. A bouncy house, like the ones at parties and lastly a mcdonalds type jungle gym but 3 times the size as the ones im used to seeing. They took a picture of mylicense, madd me fill out some forms and then they took her. It was a very sad and tough moment. More for me than her. She didnt even cry1! (i almost did! It was my first time away from her in 19 months) I gave them the diaper bag with food, drinks and toys. They said they would call me if she needs to be changed or cried a lot (uncontrollable).

The showers are large so after a workout you can get nice and clean.\n\nThey have an area for women only, just incase your insecure or dont like working out with men. This is where i went with my friend. It had man different equipment (jogging, yoga, weights, and lots of machines) everything i need for sure. We worked out and stretched here for a good 25 or so minutes. I def was sweating. Then we headed up the stairs to the men and woman tv jogging running area. It was so cool. Tons of tvs and lots of the machines had their own private tvs so you could listen or watch whatever you wanted. The machines calculate the calories, heart rate, and endurance. I lost a little over 200 calories in 20 minutes and def was sore and feeling it.\n\nLove that they have tons of different classes for free, just go on the website to see them! Kickboxing, swimming, cycling, zumba, etc. Theres def something for everyone.\n\nI really liked this place and the employees were kind and helpful. Its only 22 to join with no upfront fee. If you want the daycare then it ups it to 31 bucks but that still is crazy cheap! Plus you get two free add ons. which i chose the guest passes (2 per month), and the personal trainer.

I think it lacked lettuce but made up for it for the crap tons of bacon (super crispy), boiled egg, chicken slices, ham, a whole sliced avocado, blue cheese crumbles and the homemade ranch. I got a cup of potato soup with it which really hit the spot.

They track what you buy and send good coupons. 50 cents off pizza dough (regularly 1.69) 50 cents off sour cream (regularly 2) so the savings add's up. Especially when they also send you in the mail a $5 off coupon when you spend 25. THEN after racking up so many points you get a free $5 too. \n\nGive you a good example. Today I went and got a butt load of clearance items. It came to 35 bucks, which got me a FREE turkey (their ad special). 13 pounder.

WTG! Now i was a happy camper! She quickly got us our drinks and asked if it was our first time or  if we had any questions.\n\nLooking at the menu I quickly knew I was going to have a hard time choosing. I was stuck between the mouthwatering chicken sandwich. Another with bacon and onion straws or my favorites caesar salad & tortilla soup. What made it even harder was that the 1st two choices came with unlimited fries. You heard me... UNLIMITED FRIES! Thats a pregnant womans dream.\n\nKnowing that my hubby was getting a burger I opted for the salad and soup and figured i\'d be a ""naughty"" girl and steal some of his fries. I mean, shoot they\'re unlimited so why not.\n\nWhile waiting for our food, I turned and OMG those 4 people were still just standing there talking.. I was about to ask for the manager when i noticed a manager walking over to them and scolding. Dang! about time. They only cost the company an hours worth of pay!\n\nThe food was delish. Fries were always warm and seasoned to perfection. My salad had freshly cut lettuce and enough crutons for my hearts desires. My tortilla soup was perfect. I asked for extra cheese and sour cream. hey, im pregnant, im allowed those extra carbs! And it made it so rich and thick. Mmm, mmm. \n\nOur waitress continued to give us fantastic service. our drinks were always full. Fries always on the way. Ranch for our fries too.

Why not? I hate going out on vday and everything being packed. Another plus was my birthday was two weeks ago so I still had the coupon from my email about having a free meal with the purchase of one. (B1G1 free) How can you pass that up, when it saves you 50 bucks?!\n\nWas my first time here and I can say I was highly impressed. Our reservation wasnt until 730pm and they took us at 715pm. Score! Super glad I made reservations because there was a wait and it was a monday night too. Very surprising. I take that as a good sign.\n\nThe hostess pulled out our chairs for us and even placed napkins on our laps. Oh la la, fancy. Our waiter Joshua was excellent. He explained everything and even his favorite items that he\'s tried. He was even personable and told us about his daughter who has been doing casting calls and interviews for pirate of the caribbean movie. \n\nFood wise I was in heaven. The salad bar was delicious and I tried hard to begin lightly because many had told me its easy to fill up on it and have no room for the meats. Wasnt a fan of the green beans and almonds, but im certain its because i\'ve always had them warm, not cold. The goat cheese, prosciutto, grilled provolone and salami were perfectly paired upon the fresh warm bread. Couldnt help myself and even went back for seconds. The caesar salad was fresh and crisp, i topped it with bacon. No joke, it was the best bacon i have ever had. Part of me wanted to sneak some into my purse so i could make a BLT tomorrow. Darn. The salmon was tasty, but as well i like it better warm. The shrimp salad had perfect seasoning. The parmesan brussel sprouts were tasty and coated. The lobster bisque.. holy hell is it rich and creamy. It isnt fishy or over powering. I wish they sold it by itself. I loved it and wanted to eat an entire cup full. There were TONS of more options but i really didnt want to take a chance and fill up on salad bar items. I figured theres always next time!\n\nAs your flip your table card from red to green, your waiter brings out your table dishes. Garlic chive mash potatoes and sugar, cinnamon bananas. The potatoes really pair with the meat well. The bananas are to clear your pallet but they also make as a good dessert as well. Super sweet and light. I could have eaten them all by themselves but i paced myself. Lastly they have these cheesy bread balls that are addicting but you cant eat more than one because it\'ll ruin your meal. Fair warning cause I almost ate a bunch.\n\nDrink wise, my husband ordered a mango mojito. 11.50 and well worth it. Def a strong drink that\'ll hit you hard. Had a light mango taste but very refreshing and fruity. I ordered ice tea which has unlimited refills. The thing i loved was that your drink was never less than half way full. Your napkin was always folded when your returned to your table and the waiter always asked if there was a meat we missed or wanted more of. Very kind and courteous. I mentioned that I hadnt had the bacon wrapped filet or chicken and he had the guys bring them right away. \n\nThe meat? Ohhhhh the meat. Get in my belly! What isnt there to say. Its cooked and seasoned to perfection. The options are endless and the quality cuts are amazing. The lamb chops were very tasty and the perfect size. It wasnt chewy or too raw, which ive had at other places. The filet was medium raw and i had to have thirds! Bacon wrapped filet was a little too crunchy for me. The sirloin was good and not fatty at all! Ribs were salted and yummy. The parmesan crusted chicken was hit and miss. The chicken was tender and perfect. It sounds weird but i can only think to call it ""fluffy"" the outside was crunchy and didnt taste very parmesan cheesy. \n\nTo end the night on a good note we got the ny cheesecake. it was topped with nuts and was huge. the two of us couldnt finish it all. cutest part was our server wrote happy birthday and anniversary on it in strawberry sauce! Around the cheese cake was a beautiful design. It was done in chocolate and the circles were filled with carmel and raspberry sauce. Def the cherry ontop of the night.\n\nWorth the money?

It has about half as many options as bellagio, wicked spoon, and bacchanal. The Latin section had maybe four options.

The scallop potatoes were dry, not creamy and cold. The BBQ brisket slider was dry, the BBQ sauce disappeared into the bun and had hardly any meat. The mash potatoes were lacking something. Maybe salt? The max and cheese was good but def nothing special. I could whip something up similar in my own kitchen for my toddler.\n\nThe prime rib was very good though. Not too fatty and it was cooked just the way I enjoy it.. Medium rare. I actually went back for seconds. Another item that I thought was cool, was a pick your salad and they toss/make it for you. I liked that. I haven't seen that at other buffets. But honestly that was the only special item. \n\nThe desserts were blah, nothing special yet again except one item.. The lemon bars! Yum.

I tihnk they're dry, burnt yet under cooked and flavorless.. YET here i saw their hash browns and had to get them. They were the best tasting hash browns i've ever had in my life.

It wasn't the comfiest but we knew we would have to break it in. We wanted something sturdy to last for a couple years and to with stand the jumping and torture of our 15 month old. All together it was going to cost us 860 and it said on the sign 940. Good deal. I had decided to get a coffee table and two stands in dark chocolate to match for 169. expensive but oh well. I wanted everything matching. All together with tax (88 bucks) and the delivery/set up fee (65 bucks) it came to a total of 1186. Not too bad but way over our budget. Ouch.

Tried the caesar salad, which was perfectly sized and great paired with bread. Then i tried the feta watermelon salad. It was so different! I had never had something like that, weird but crazy good. As i walked by I saw honey comb dripping & so fresh. Never seen that before either! Awesome! They said they have it flown in from Canada!\n\nNext I went for the asian side. Had to try the veggie rolls, since I'm a huge fan. They were so crunchy & fresh. I could have gone back for 2nds & 3rds but i had to save room for everything else. I hate duck but was willing to be open minded & try it! It was mouthwatering, literally melted in your mouth. The fat was delectable. Orange chicken was unusual. Had never had it taste like that before but it was great tasting, dont get me wrong. It tasted like chicken fried steak to me & the sauce gave it this asian fusion. YUM! Dumpling & fried rice were nothing special. I passed on those after one bite. Korean rib was a little tough but full of spice. \n\nGoing back for my third plate, I saw a vegetarian quesadilla filled with mozzarella, carrots and some greens tuff & topped with guac, salsa & sour cream. Holy moly, i never would have guess a veg dish would be so good! Grabbed the lasagna, which i think sat under the heater too long cause it was cold & the top was really hard. I wasnt a fan, it didnt taste authentic. Cute skillet though. Meatball was also tough but in a fantastic sauce that was packed with great italian seasonings. Went back for more of the meats & cheeses. i HAD to! The bree was heaven sent, especially when paired with the bread they had out & fresh cut bruschetta.Got a mini frier with chicken strips & fries. It was def comfort food & tasted as if they had gotten the recipe straight from popeyes. \n\nHit up the mini burgers which were to die for! We asked what cut were they & they said prime! It was the tastiest burger Ive had in my life. I even went back for a second one! The mini heinz ketchups they had were the perfect size and handy. I didnt feel as if 20 other people had touched the ketchup i had. Im a germ phob. (SSH, dont tell anyone). Large selection of comfort food mash potato, sweet potatoe fries, baked skins & wings but i wanted to try other things, so i skipped trying them. next time! \n\nNoticed the cooks make fresh to order tacos with carne asada. Wow, was it tender! Fiesta spiced goodness! The tortillas were amazing w/extra zing! Impressive. I couldnt believe they made the torillas (corn and flour) right in front of you. Ive never seen that done before.The sauce bar they had was insane. About 15 different sauces & toppings. YUM! I wish i could have tried them all. Prime rib, asparagus & carrot were next. Prime rib was good but im used to bellagio melt in your mouth type. Saw lots of soups so decided the try the lobster bisque! Holy moly was it good! I loved it! Best seafood soup Ive ever had! I would probably go back to the buffet just for that alone, especially paired w/ the corn bread.\n\nMy 4th plate consisted of the beef tamale which lacked the correct spices, they just didnt taste as good as mine.. maybe im biast a little, since i make tamales all the time. The mexican sope meat pie was topped w/ guac & cheese, very good, a little soggy but i expected that. Lastly, i had the asian pork ramen. The bowl was large, the guy made the soup fresh in front of us. It was my 1st time having it. Way to set the bar guys! \n\nDessert started w/ tirimisu, which had crunchy balls inside. Different but i wouldnt get it again. Blueberry Tart shot was gross, too tart. Lemon cheescake had a gold flake on it! amazingly tasty and gave that wow factor! Lemon cupcake was okay not a fan of the yogurt tasting frosting, so i ate just the cake. Large selection of sugar free desserts for diabetics?! Sweet! You hardly see that at buffets, well at least not that large of a selection. They had tons of cake/cookie pops. The little kid in me wanted to grab every one of them and run. Carrot cake was moist and good but had too much frosting. Banana souffle? Fluffy & full of flavor. I dont understand how they have it ready and cooked to perfection when they usually take 40 or more minutes to make. Chocolate chip cookie topped w/brown sugar ice cream was delicious. lemon tart? Pure perfection! Lastly i tried the azteca chocolate chile ice cream. best chocolate ice cream Ive ever had. Asked what was in it and he said chile and cinnamon.

Awesomeness! \n\nThe hostess sat us (party of 7) at a breathtaking round table. It had its own gorgeous wine chandelier dangling in the middle. I felt as if we were VIP. The chairs were super large, grey and comfy. Didnt give that buffet vibe but that, extreme vintage dining feel. My toddler loved them and actually (for the 1st time ever!) didnt try to climb out of her chair. The world must really be coming to an end i tell you.\n\nThe waiter was quick to get us our drinks, offer a wine list and ask if we had any questions or needed a highchair. \n\nOff to stuff myself, yes i skipped breakfast, I went first for the cheese and meat section. The selection was good, but not as good as the dinner. They were missing brie and a couple other cheese's. Boo. Still, there was a good amount and they were super tasty. On that same plate I added a chicken, cheese and chile tamale. It was warm, juicy and full of flavor. Not to mention huge. Bigger than any tamale I've ever seen. Perfecto. Lastly on my plate I made myself a caesar salad. I noticed they no longer had the pre portioned caesar salad which was sized to fit my needs. no biggie, I made my own. It was very good. It was the first time I noticed that the crutons were fresh and made from.. cornbread? Delish!\n\nPlate #2, had mac n cheese on it. Nothing too special. I guess lately I've been mac and cheese'd out, thanks to my daughter. Next to that was their salmon. Holy moly, it was very good. Not the best salmon, since it was plain. But it was fresh, non fishy, juicy and flakey. Wished it had some sort of buttery or peppery taste. Cant complain too much, when i literally almost licked the spot where the salmon sat. Finally, on that plate I had two tacos. A steak and pork. These were the best items I had at the buffet. The gentlemen made my flour tortillas, and cooked the meat right before my eyes. Then he loaded it. Whats loaded you ask? Cilantro, green sauce and onions. Nom NOM Nom. If you want anything extra (I.e sour cream, salsa, etc, its on the other side) I almost was going to go back for, NO JOKE 4 more but then everyone at the table reminded me that I had dessert still to try. DARN :( Until next time my sweet tacos!\n\nDesserts were good. Didnt see them making any of their souffles. Huge let down. Chocolate strawberrys were tasty and good. Reminded me of how much Ive missed them (HINT hunny, our anniversary is coming up!) Had to try the sticky toffee ice cream. it was okay, tasty but honestly it wasnt as toffee as I expected. I could barely taste it and wouldnt have known it was toffee unless it was in the name. Lastly I had to get a crepe. I missed them my first time here and I wasnt about to leave without one. The lady working the crepe making station was super nice. She chatted with me about my daughter and told me about her's. Its friendliness like that, thats what really makes me come back to a restaurant. She quickly made it, diced up a banana and then put a huge spoonful of whip topping (i asked for extra!) and then drizzled nutella and chocolate all over. It looked spectacular and tasted even more so. it was a big size and I made sure to finish that puppy.\n\nYet again I loved the caesars buffet and cant wait to come back.

One was cheddar bacon and the other cheddar ranch. We were served six and one of them was not cleaned out. it still had the peppers inside and super hot.

I hate when my meat is over odne and this was perfect. Medium rare and juicy. The flavors were perfect and the toppings were off the charts.

Sliced turkey breast, crispy bacon (best I ever had!) lettuce tomato, mayo. \n\nBig amount of meat, and the same seasoning as capriottis almost. Why not five stars? They're sandwiches were tiny. Or maybe I'm a fatty and they just seems small? I don't know, I think they were a bit bigger than a subway six inch. \n\nThe part that really surprised me was there service. Delivered to my work in less than six minutes?! Unbelievable. If I didn't know better I would shave thought this guy made it in his car. How do they make them so fast? I need to know their tricks.\n\nIt's free for extra mayo, onion, tomatoes, lettuce, sliced cucumber, and Dijon mustard. \n\nThey have kettle cooked chips which are my favorite. This sandwich place is going to be my new go to pace for when I'm at work or at home feeling lazy. We all know my sandwiches at home are not as good. \n\nJimmy johns expect a date next week. You. Me.

I feel like a child who has a million things running through my head but can't say them all at once.\n\nWe headed towards the produce first, which had amazingly good prices and had a great choice of chiles, dried fruit and beans. The only part I didn't like was the dried fruit section you needed someone to help you and we stood for ten minutes with no one showing up. \n\nMoving on, we went down an isle that had all the Mexican candies, at exceptional prices. They had the big Mexican brand cupcakes, cookies and chips. My husband was like a giddy little girl and are basket was full of junk he grew up with. I admit I through a couple items in myself, charge me guilty.\n\nNext, we saw their meat selection. Holy cow! Come with patience to wit because there was a long line and a selection that was mind boggling. From pig feet, to brain, regular steak, to intestines. Seasoned or unseasoned, in big qualities and affordable prices. Can't wait to buy the stuff for my tamales here. E meat looked so fresh, I could tell they sell a lot of meat per day.\n\nWalking by, on the left is a fresh salsa, drinks and fruits. Fruit salad, fresh water melon drinks, hot salsas, cactus fruit, etc etc. They had about four different sour creams, don't ask me. What the differences were but I picked one and bought it. It was creamy, milky and hella good. So fresh I could have sworn they made it that day. Sorry dallop a daisy, I've found a new sour cream.\n\nNext I noticed they have a fresh tortilla factory, where they make them fresh, and were making them as we walked by. Corn, flour and special corn tortillas made for my favorite.. Flauntas! They're oval and made just for them. \n\nWe decided to stop at their...? Deli? Restaurant? Quick order section?

Awesome.\n\nLet me tell you about this new little Mexican place that just opened up between the corner gas station and the creative kids. This place had been advertising that they're opening soon for two months, and they're finally open. \n\nThe owner is extremely nice, friendly, and quick to charm you up on the dishes his store makes. He even offers to let you sample the chicken and steak before making a decision.\n\nSince we've been waiting for him to open he offered to let us try a taco for free. Other than that we ordered and bought the fish taco, chicken taco, chile relleno. and bean and cheese burrito.\n\nFirst off the bean and cheese burrito was the cheesiest burrito I've ever had in my entire life! Maybe too much cheese... wait, what the heck am I saying?! There is no such thing as too much cheese!! It was ooey gooey goodness, with a freshly made tortilla. A little too flimsy but in overall deliciousness, it didnt matter. It hit the spot. \n\nThe salsa's could use a little more flavor. The only one I really enjoyed was the chunky brown one, that has onions in it. \n\nThe chicken tacos were full of flavor and had a good amount of meat inside them. Definitely, not wimpy tacos and worth the price. They top them with onions, cilantro, and lettuce if you request it. \n\nThe food takes longer than a fast food joint but thats because they make everything fresh. What i loved was that i could see the grill from the cash register. No gimmicks, no hidden secrets. What you see is what you get. I'd rather wait an extra five or so minutes and have something fresh, hot and healthier than something you get thats been sitting for hours. \n\nThe store is small, clean and everything brand new. They have a tv for customers to watch while they eat, which is nice. Free refills on drinks, except the horchata. \n\nLastly i tried the chile relleno which was really spicy but in a great way. Full of cheese again, and topped with grilled onions and red sauce. \n\nThis place uis a hit, and overall im super excited its here.

Got the fish taco and no joke it's the BEST fish taco I've ever had. Before my favorite was wahoos but the flavor, and size of apaches fish taco blew wahoos away. It's tender, not fishy, fried outside that crunchy, not soggy. For 2.99 it was huge and I wish I would have gotten a second. The chipotle sauce they put on it gives it a kick that really brings out the flavor. They don't skimp on the cabbage and put it on two corn tortillas that don't break. \n\nThe second taco I got was still good, marinated chicken. I found out you can get it on a flour tortilla too but I stuck with corn. So much meat that you could almost order another corn tortilla ad stuff another. Great prices for portions, and I find myself having more food than I can eat. \n\nRice and beans taste super fresh, and again I love I watch them make everything and grill it. \n\nWhat's new as well is that they changed their salsa bar and now I can't stop raving. They added a new chunky green mild one that packs a punch after you start chewing. And they spiced up their salsa, the brown chunky one. Now I have no complaints!

BUT is absolutely delicious! If baby poop was that delicious I would eat it everyday. Even my husband was a little afraid to eat it, and was pleasantly surprised at how great tasting it was. He thought it tasted like the green tea ice cream just in custard form. \n\nThe usual sushi I get. Tiger, spicy tuna crunch, lobster and screaming were just as top notch as they usually are. It came out super fast and fresh. I thought it may have tasted a little fresher..

We arrived at the location a bit early and checked in, thinking we might have a chance at getting in early, no dice, the hostess suggests a Drink, waving her hand and pointing towards the casino floor, so off we went to gamble a bit and have a cocktail.  We returned, to the same hostess, with cocktails in hand only to be told that we needed to ""finish those first"" before being seated (referring to our casino drink that she suggested we buy), small hiccup but sets the tone.  So then she proceeds to give us a VERY canned presentation on the restaurant, you can tell she has said the same bit about being transported from Paris to London via the Tunnel about a thousand times.  The crew at Disney says the same lines day after day but you would never catch one of them offering the lackluster performance that we witnessed.\n\nSo, great booth overlooking the restaurant, seated, and away we go.  We decided before that we would all order a little differently so that we could sample as wide a variety as possible.  So here is what we found;\n\nIt was busy, we found that our server seemed a little rushed, he also spoke very softly, which in a fairly busy dinner service creates a little frustration. \n\nTwo prices, face it, this is just stupid, showing me that someone with a ""card"" saves a dollar"" is like telling me that most people who gamble in Vegas lose, worthless info. \n\nDinners, the meat if you will.  They can cook a steak, I\'m a mid-western boy, raised on well cooked beef and damn if this steak wasn\'t melt in your mouth good (both the NY Strip and Rib-eye).  Top 3 steaks I\'ve ever had, EVER.\n\nWellington, Um disappointing.  It was fine really, cooked well but I found the dough to be a little soft and underdone that was on the meat side.  I guess we just expected more.  It was flavorful and well cooked..\n\nAhi, Serious disappointment.  Had large amounts of connective tissue. It lay picked over and un-eaten. We were asked if it was okay, and we offered a shrug and said that we have had better.  They cleared the plate, offered a replacement and it was taken off the bill without asking, nicely played if you ask me.\n\nApps;\n\nGarden Salad. average, even the cheese was just middle of the road\n\nGnocchi, decent.  Nice, better than most, but not the best.\n\nBrussel Sprouts, severe disappointment, drastically under-cooked, sent them back only to find them under-seasoned.  There are too few people who like this veg, when you serve them like this, its no wonder they lose fans, its a wonder the Brussel sprout council hasn\'t started picketing outside your doors!\n\nOverall, with all the mis-ques,I doubt we will return, there are far too many better choices in Vegas.', u'votes': {u'funny': 1, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 2}, u'stars': 3, u'sentiment': 0.10090225563909776}]"

On the right side is a long list of toppings for your burger, ranging from the mundane to the extravagant.

And boy does Sensi not disappoint.  \n\nSight:  Impeccable.  The restaurant is laid out in four different kitchens, plus a dessert kitchen and a bread bakery.  The decor is sleek and contemporary, with natural materials:  light colored woods, large pieces of hewn stone, sometimes rough and natural, sometimes polished smooth, with brushed metal accents and flowing water.  There were many different dining rooms as well, with 6 or so tables in each, so it feels intimate no matter where you are.  The staff is well-dressed and groomed, with clean, simple uniforms.  The plates were all unique, and \n\nTouch:  The seats were comfortable and the table was smooth and nice to touch, while the appetizer plates had an interesting texture.  The cool soft water of the vanishing edge fountains was nice, and was clearly either distilled or at least purified with salt (otherwise I suppose the fountains would get silty).  Along with the glass and the polished stone, very nice texture-wise.  (Though no one goes to restaurants to feel on things.  Oh well.)\n\nSmell:  Tantalizing.  The first brush is the Indian tandoori, with hints of curry.  The smell of the fresh bread was exquisite as well, and being seated next to the bread bakery was a plus in that department.  The light salt scent of fresh seafood was there, as well as garlicy and buttery hints, though I\'m not sure from where, exactly.\n\nSound:  I can\'t say that it was the most amazing place with sound.  You hear the typical restaurant sounds of plates and the shuffling feet of wait-staff.  There was either no music, or it was too light to be heard, though the sound of running water was nice.  We talked throughout, as well, so I suppose that that wasn\'t too big a deal.  It was *not* loud and echo-y, though, as you might expect from the stone and glass used.  I\'m guessing the wood in the ceiling and floor helped to damp it, but I\'m not sure.\n\nTaste:  I\'m sorry while I tear up a little.  The food was very good.  Very good indeed.  We started with cocktails (didn\'t feel like wine that night, and I wasn\'t sure what I was ordering yet), but it was the perfect mix of citrus and rum, and I really enjoyed it.   We were given slices of at least 3 or 4 kinds of bread, freshly baked and sliced right behind us, with butter and a chive spread.  It was great.  Next, we ordered Tuna 3-ways, and the Thai Lobster and Shrimp rolls, and they were very good.  The fish was fresh, and had a unique flavor that one could dream about.  The rolls were good as well, but I think a little more cilantro could\'ve helped it along to perfection.  We had a bit of everything.  Lamb, Scallops, Steak, and Lobster (the four of us with one each), and usually you don\'t share at a fine dining restaurant, but the food was too good not to sample some of everyone\'s plate. The lamb was in a light and flakey pastry with just the right done-ness, the scallops had the most rich and subtle lightly buttered taste, the lobster was served Indian style, and the steak was rich and full, and the largest thing served there.  I had the tapioca pudding for dessert, and it really is THE BEST as they advertise, the creme brulee was to die for, especially the unique pistachio, and I can\'t recall was it was called, but the chocolate log was great, and I\'m not usually much for chocolate.  Nothing I didn\'t like at all from Sensi.  When we left, we were given a small box of cookies, a nice touch, and each was very good.\n\nService (the Sixth Sense):  We were seated almost immediately for our reservation.  The hostess was gracious, addressed the party by name, and slowly walked us through the restaurant to our seat.  The table setting had everything, each person having a bread plate, a water glass, a wine glass, two forks, and a knife.   The wine menu is expansive and much larger than the food menu, with all ranges of pricing (none cheap, though).  The hostess let us sit down, and the three adults put their napkins in their laps, and the hostess put the napkin in the child\'s lap herself.  \nThe waiter came by, introduced himself, and offered us choice of water, and promptly took the wine glass from the minor\'s place setting.  Since we\'d informed him of a birthday in the party, that person was served first, and then the waiter would move completely across the table to the lady second (it was clear she\'d be first if it wasn\'t for the birthday celebrant).  All the little touches were there, with the glasses removed or refilled as needed, and when two in the party got up to go to the restroom, leaving their napkins on the chairs, the napkins were quickly removed, and new, folded napkins were left near the place setting.  The steak was not finished during the meal, so it was boxed up in a container, and placed in a stylish carrying back with Sensi on the front.  The wait staff took care of every need, but tended to stay out of your way.  Just how I like it.\n\nSensi deserves every star.

Keep in mind, from 11:30 to 3, Mon-Sat, they have happy hour, which many of the sushi items are half off, and this is what I recommend to just sit and sample the fresh nigiri.  If you come at dinner, get the rolls.  All of them are gigantic, and more than worth the full price.  \n\nThe place itself is very well decorated, with stone and contemporary stylings, although the music in there can be hit or miss.  I've been there about 3 times now, and one time it was bouncy loud hip-hop crap with repetitive rhythms and vocalists who talk the whole time instead of singing.  The second time it was techno remixes of pop songs, and that was more bearable.

The exhibits are arranged in number order to correspond with the free audio tour wand, which has an explanation of a few of the things to look for at the piece.  The gallery changes themes about twice a year, and is actually quite well-curated.  Rather than being a giant art gallery, it has more of the feel of a small artist's gallery, and is themed as such.  \n\nThe only thing holding me back from a 5-star review is the price.  It is simply too expensive for many people out there, and a lot of them will feel cheated for the money.  At a stout $15 per person, it can seem a bit pricey, especially with places like the Met at NYC can be entered for a mere $5.  \n\nI think that this gallery is to be relegated to being a locals gallery, since they can get a discount (even more for students), and it is one of a very small set of galleries in the Las Vegas area.

For the uninitiated, here's what TFT does as its business model.  \n\nIf a show is not sold out on a particular day, TFT asks the show box office about how many tickets they can have to sell, and the show box office sets aside tickets that they probably wouldn't sell to give to people who buy at TFT.  So, right off the bat, you know you're getting seats that are by no means the best.  Show box offices will give their worst seats, count on that, and will try to be conservative.  Let's say they have 200 open seats, think they can fill 170 on their own.  They give TFT 30 in the morning of the very worst in the house.  Later in the day, they have 100 and feel pessimistic, so they give TFT 20 more of somewhat better seats.  \n\nFrom the customer point of view, here are the steps:\n\nCons: \n\n1)  You must be there early.  TFT only has a limited number of tickets available per show.\n2)  You must stand in line, from 30 minutes to an hour at the TFT booth in order buy a voucher.\n3)  You must go as soon as you can to the box office of the show you want to attend, and get assigned a seat.  This may entail another line, maybe 30 minutes again.  This is somewhat hit-or-miss.  You may get a better (less bad) seat if you come earlier, or you may get lucky and get a better (less bad) seat if you come later.  \n4)  You must come back to the show venue again at the time for your actual show.  \n5)  You only get half-off for the really terrible shows that have no hope of selling out.  Top-of-the-line shows will range in savings from $10 to $30 at most, which is hardly half.\n6)  No refunds, no exchanges, they don't care if you're dying or got hit by a truck.  Once they have your money, they don't give it back.\n7)  Ticket Offices will assign a name to each sale, and if you lose your tickets, they'll give you an emergency set.  Lose your TFT voucher, and you're SOL, since they have no way of knowing who you are.\n\nPros:  \n\n1)  Save $10-$20.  \n\nShow box offices are 1000 times more flexible with refunds and cancellations, you don't have to wake up early, you only stand in line once, they'll upgrade you if they have better seats, you get to choose any seat in the house instead of just the TFT block, and they probably have better discounts already because of the economy.    \n\nIn my opinion, this service is a waste of time and money.  Most people make more money in an hour than they'd save for the hour of lines and hassles of TFT.  Besides, you're on vacation.  Do you really want to get up early to save a few dollars on mediocre seats?

They have tabasco, jalapeno tabasco, Tapatio, Cholula, and at least three more different kinds of hot sauces in bottles that I hadn't even heard of.  \n\nI have not had any of the desserts, but I have no doubt they're just good and high in quality as the rest of the menu.

Being an impersonator/singer, Terry really needs you to be able to know the songs and get in the mood for them, so this was a good way to do that.  Don't worry, he doesn't sing any of the songs in the pre-show.  Things like Sweet Caroline, YMCA, and the like will have you singing in the seats.  \n\nAfter he's done spinning tracks, the iPod dock goes away, and he does the Evolution of Dance routine from YouTube, which is impressive, and sets you up really well for Terry himself.  \n\nTerry starts out with an amazing Etta James song, and the laughs and the singing don't stop from then on.  He sometimes sings through a puppet without moving his mouth, which is incredible, and when the song calls for something more difficult, he'll sing as himself.  I've seen him three times already, and some of his jokes I'd heard that many times, and I still laugh out loud.  By far my most favorite part is the human puppet part.  I couldn't stop laughing, and neither could anyone else in the theater.  I'd pay the full ticket price just to see that act.  \n\nA final odd thing, though.

The waitstaff was dressed nicely in a modern style, and we were treated very well.  This place takes reservations, and does get full, so try to get there on time.  \n\nThe first step is to enter from the ground floor in a private elevator that goes straight to the top.  The hostess upstairs checks you in, and you are seated at your table.  The restaurant is rather slim, so as to maximize the view of the Las Vegas valley.  The windows are all panoramic floor-to-ceiling, and the booths are faced to the window a little further back, and the free tables are right up against it.  They have lounge-like chairs around shorter tables, more for drinking and appetizers, and regular height tables and chairs for dinner guests.  \n\nThey also have a bar and wine is served by the ounce using an enomatic system and a smart card.  Basically you get a card and put a certain amount of money in it, and then you can sample several kinds of wines yourself by placing your glass under the spout, swiping the card, and then choosing the amount.  This is great for tasting lots of different kinds of wine without feeling self-conscious about a snooty sommlier telling you what's good and what sucks.  \n\nThe menu is simple, and offers a few choices for food.  They have sushi rolls at a reasonable price ($9-$15), and nigiri that's a little bit more than usual.  The sashimi is less than usual, I'd say.

We also had the pleasure of trying the opakapaka nigiri, which was absolutely to die for...  Fresh and delicious and a totally unique flavor.  Highly recommended.  The entrees were good, as well, and were not too pricey.  The most expensive thing (barring market price items) was probably under $40, and I believe that was the filet mignon.  \n\nIt was the birthday of one of our party, and while they don't sing or anything, they do give you a free dessert.

I'm thinking it was connected to the lobby bar, and apparently has an oyster bar on it as well, but we stuck to the traditional steak house portion, I guess.  \n\nWe had a reservation, and were actually late for it, but they accomdated us, and even seated us on the beautiful patio seating outside, in amazing weather.  The tables were all made of wood, and the chairs were comfortable enough, though the cushions moved a little here and there.  Our server was polite, and prompt, and was forthcoming with advice on foods to sample here and there, but being seasoned restaurant eaters, we had our own ideas, naturally.  \n\nEnded up with the crab cakes and beef carpaccio for appetizers.  The crab cakes were amazing x.x.  I could've eaten twelve of them!  There were two kinds on the plate, ones that were fried with a breading on the outside, with a mayonnaisey sauce to dip, and another with more of a tartar-like taste, and both were great.  The carpaccio was good, too, but somewhat ordinary.  Maybe I'm just jaded.  \n\nI think it might've taken a little longer than normal for those to arrive, but we were having a lot of fun chatting so it's possible we just didn't notice.  I think we had the red house wine, which was fine, but I'd just had a very good cabernet, and so in comparison, this one wasn't quite as good, but still nice.  \n\nOf all the restaurants at M (I think I've tried them all now, except the Buffet), this one is probably the most pricey.  They have nice fine cuts of steak, and the ones raised on the Marnell Ranch were about 1.5 times as much as the regular steaks.  No one ordered those, though, so we can't tell you how much better they were.  \n\nWe ordered the Filet Mignon, a juicy Rib Eye, the Day Boat Scallops, and the special of the day, lamb chops.  The filet was good, but nothing exceptionally original.  The sauce was great, and I couldn't quite place the flavor, but it was somewhat creamy and had a bit of a mustard taste to it.  \n\nThe ribeye was thick and juicy, and didn't have any exceptional flavors to it, but was certainly a very good steak.  It was bone-in, as all good ribeyes are, and cooked to perfection, medium-rare.  Good flavor, and again the artistry in this dish was the accompanying sauce, this one more brown, and seemed to be a bit of some vinegar and almost gravy-like consistency, with a soft woody taste.  \n\nThe scallops were kind of ordinary-tasting.  They weren't bad, and the consistency was nice on them, they just weren't something I'd jump up and down over.  I much preferred the scallops at Sensi (see my other review).  \n\nThe lamb was over cooked, but that's the fault of the person ordering it, who wanted it medium-well.  Everyone knows you should have lamb medium-rare!  But it wasn't too hard, though it seemed as though there weren't any jump-out flavors.  Good, but I wouldn't get it again.  We did not have dessert this time.\n\nGreat view, calm atmosphere, good service, and fun company all combined to make this a great meal for us!

Oddly, despite liking everything that was served, the chicken pot pie was the best I had ever tasted, and I doubt I will ever have one like that again.  Steaks were cooked to order, and I sampled the filet mignon, the porterhouse, and the strip steak, and oddly of all of them, I think the strip steak was the most flavorful, and was the cheapest.  \n\nOf the sides, I highly recommend the hot potato salad and the sauteed mushrooms, while I did not like the scalloped potatoes at all.  The seafood platter was excellent, as well, with the sauce a perfect mixture of cream and spice.

The menu was like what you'd see at a hole-in-the-wall bar, but with much more upscale (and dare I say, creative) ingredients.  We were treated to a free piece of pretzel bread, along with three different kinds of mustard.  Each was delicious in its own way, and very-well complemented the pretzel bread.  I cannot concur with my fellow yelpers about the freshness (or lack thereof) of the pretzel.  This was the right mix of chewy and soft that you expect from a salty pretzel.  Maybe the people who weren't impressed expected an Auntie Anne's style pretzel-shaped soft-breadstick?  \n\nWe had the Philly Cheesesteak Dumplings, and they were great.  A great and unique combination, and very creative.  I recommend those.  For the entree, I had the filet, with mushroom and crepes, and I absolutely loved it.  The meat was cooked exactly as I wanted it, and the mushrooms were earthy and sweet, and worked well with the crepes.  I wanted to lick the plate at the end after all that!

Everything is just mediocre.  \n\nFirst, the decor was the best thing about it.  It was new, well-painted, pretty paintings and new chairs and tables with granite on top.  There were nice fake plants on the ceilings and walls, and the bathroom was clean, and nice.  The problem is that the tables had this bar under them where my friend kept hitting his knees against.  The tables were set so close together that I could probably have reached over to the other table and stolen a spring roll off of it.\n\nSpeaking of the spring rolls, they were just not good.  The flour sheets on the spring rolls were chewy, and they did not have that nice crunchy stuff in the center that tastes really good, like the ones at Lemongrass.  The dipping sauce was good, but not exceptional.\n\nThe pho was the biggest let-down today.  Pho Saigon 8 on Spring Mountain had rich, full broth, that seemed just a little too fatty, and was very good.  This one was rather thin, and its flavor was easily masked by any of the things that you could put in it.  For example, more basil meant that the pho tasted like basil and not pho.  Add bean sprouts, and the pho tasted like water and not much else.  The meat was good, though, and they put a liberal amount of green onion, which I always like.\n\nI also tried the lemon soda.  This was a very good soda, although it was much too sweet.  I think it could have benefited from having more lemon flavor and less sugar in it.  \n\nThey have no sandwiches.  \n\nIn addition, everything there is smaller, and/or more expensive than Lemongrass, right across the street.  For example, the large pho was the same price for both, but the bowl is smaller was easily finished by myself and my friend.  We've almost never finished a large pho at Lemongrass.  The Vietnamese seafood crepe was both smaller *and* more expensive, by as much as $0.50-$1.00, and while good, made me a little skittish about ordering it again.  The Spring Rolls were the same price, but came with only two instead of three like at Lemongrass.  \n\nMuch as I want to see more pho places around, I simply cannot recommend this place with Lemongrass Cafe so close to it.  Maybe if it was in the middle of rural Nevada with no other competition, it would have impressed me more.

I got a Restaurant.com coupon, and was totally craving some good Italian food, but I'm also a big fan of Japanese food so this combination of Italian-Japanese sounded great.  The location was okay, though a bit hard to find.  The place was well-decorated, as you'd expect for a Japanese place, and the waitress was nice, though not particularly energetic nor friendly.  \n\nThe menu was interesting.  Since I wanted to try their uniqueness, and not where they're the same as any other Japanese place, I wanted to focus on the pasta.  We ordered a chicken pasta with Japanese mushrooms, along with a salisbury steak made of beef and kurobuta pork.  For an appetizer, we had the calamari tempura, and dessert was a gelato with Kinako and black honey.  Here's each in turn:\n\nCalamari Tempura:  Nothing special, despite being on the specials menu.  It was exactly what it says:  Deep-friend pieces of squid (Japanese cut) with breading.  \n\nChicken with Japanese mushrooms:  Weird.  Basically it was a spaghetti in a broth, with a few pieces of chicken and some mushrooms in it.  I can't really describe the taste, aside from it being fairly bland and a bit salty.  It didn't seem like the mushrooms added much to the flavor, and all together seemed like a thrown together mish-mash.  \n\nBeef and Kurobuta Pork Salisburg Steak:  Entirely mediocre.  It's just a Salisbury steak.  This one came with a salad, two slices of orange, a sprig of broccoli, and small pasta birdsnest.  The cold pasta thing was really good, actually.  Saved the dish from being entirely forgettable.\n\nGelato with Kinako and Black Honey:  This was pretty good.  Seemed like a sweet cream gelato with a bittersweet honey and kinako crumbs, which added nothing almost to the flavor, but was a good choice for some texture to what would otherwise have been plain ice cream.  \n\nOverall, the service was a bit a slow, and not very friendly, but not rude.

Not only is the floor covered in food and trash, the placemats are LITERALLY STUCK to the tables. I only noticed this after the table was haphazardly wiped down by one of their disgruntled employees, and I went to flip my placemat that was crusted with food debris. Big mistake. After prying it loose from the table, I find that I was apparently looking at the ""clean"" side. This has occurred not only once, but three times total. \n\nNeedless to say that at this point, I will no longer return. If this is the way the front of the house is maintained, I can only imagine the numerous health code violations in the back of the house. Extremely disappointing for a venue with ample potential. \n\nOh, and the service- horrific.', u'votes': {u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}, u'stars': 1, u'sentiment': -0.10701840894148586}, {u'text': u'This restaurant is fantastic!

Now there is an ATM conveniently located in the lobby that charges $2.50 plus we all have those pesky non ATM fees our banks charge. So when I pay $2.50 at their ATM (cause the operator gets a kickback from the owner) and my $2.50 NON ATM fee at my bank my wash has now cost me an additional $5.00 so that I can tip the detailer cleaning my car.

I\'m talking about a time when being smooth was what it was all about and the dolls bore names like Marilyn Monroe, Judy Garland, and Shirley Maclaine. \n\nI am also a big fan of Vegas and despite it\'s several facelifts over the years the gold mine in the desert is one of my favorite places on the planet. This is where the magic happened and sometimes still does, especially when I\'m rollin the dice and lady luck is kind to me. Unlike many who go for the mega-clubs, rollercoaster\'s, and the latest Cirque du Soleil act. I go for the nostalgic shows and spots that make Vegas . . . VEGAS BABY!!!\n\nOne such stop is the legendary Golden Steer. This place is where the rats themselves would frequent which automatically makes it a must on my to do list. So after arriving in town Niki and I got ourselves ready and hit the road. Golden Steer is located on W Sahara Avenue just off the strip. Parking is convenient and it may not look like much on the outside but just wait. When you enter it is like you have been time warped to the late 50\'s-early 60\'s. The decor has an old school class that is rarely seen anymore but strangely still sheik. The wood plank walls and red leather booths set the scene and one feels transported to a different time almost instantly after being seated. \n\nThe staff is impeccable and informative answering every question and open to offering recommendations without making one feel uninformed. Drinks are a must and something classic is on my mind. I order a whiskey sour and as quickly as I ordered it arrives. It is absolutely perfect and if you like classic cocktails I guarantee that this is the place. When the waiter returned to take our order. To start we ordered the Caesar Salad for two prepared tableside. For our entrees Niki ordered the NY Strip and I the Prime Rib - End Cut with a Jumbo Baked Potato.\n\nIn a few short minutes a table was wheeled over and the salad was prepared. It was a show all by itself and it was clear this fellow has made this many times over the years. Let the eating begin. This is not your usual Caesar Salad by any means. The mix of vegetables makes this a more hearty Caesar but the hints of spice and anchovies is blended perfectly to taste.\n\nAfter we were finished with our salads the entrees and sides arrived. Niki\'s strip was so tender she could cut it with a fork and my prime rib was equally tender and thick. Both cooked medium rare, juicy, and oh so delicious. This steak ranks up there at the top of my all time favorites.\n\nThe jumbo potato was simply that - jumbo. It was huge and cooked perfectly. It came with chives, sour cream, and butter. The combination as always, spectacular.\n\nNow I know that Golden Steer is known for it\'s Bananas Foster prepared tableside but I am not that big a fan. So Niki and I order the cheesecake. I know it is a safe option but boy it was good. thick, creamy, with a hint of vanilla. Niki is a big fan of cheesecake and nothing gets between her and a slice especially when the quality is this superb.\n\nSo that\'s it folks, the shows over. When in Vegas, do what the boys used to do. Enjoy a great meal at Golden Steer and you\'ll be swingin like Deano himself. Since I got our attention I want to leave you with a quote from the man himself.\n\n""I feel sorry for people who don\'t drink.

This occasion was no different. The hotel had everything covered and that included all the meals and entertainment.

At the most; it makes it barely worth the 36/night. The ONLY reason I recommend staying here is if you need somewhere to stay in Tempe for a little while at a very cheap price.\n\nBad things:\n\nMany broken appliances/lights. \n\nYou need to jiggle the bathroom light a few hundred times just to have it turn on. The microwave doesn\'t turn; and even when I do get it to work for 30 second intervals, it\'s so broken that the microwave seems to target only one part of it, and burn the crap out of whatever you put in there.\n\nThe ac outlets are annoying, to say the least. They\'re all so loose most things don\'t fit in them, or easily fall/get knocked out. Just charging my phone turns into a nightmare.\n\nDirty; to the point of it being disgusting.\n\nForget having clean bed sheets. The most the maids do is take the old ones and straighten them on the bed; the top layer got so disgusting, my girlfriend and I took it off and stuffed it in a corner the first day we stayed here. It has yet to be so much as touched by the maids after 2 weeks of service. Then again, I haven\'t seen them do more than make the bed and quickly wipe down the counters.\n\nThere is a MAJOR problem with pests here. I\'ve seen other people commenting on this; and you need to know, if you\'re squeamish about squishing or seeing roaches and crickets: DO NOT STAY HERE. We have found a total of 2 crickets and 4 cockroaches crawling around the bathroom, and room constantly. I trapped 4 of them to show the front desk, and they basically said they\'d get someone to spray. It was another 24 hours before anyone got here and did anything. \n\nThe bathrooms look like they haven\'t have been thoroughly cleaned in years. The air filters have mold; and the toilet pipes are rusted and nasty.\n\nThe walls are very, very thin.\n\nYou can hear regular conversations like you\'re in the same room. Thank god the people next door only stayed a couple days.\n\nThe free Internet.\n\nIf you don\'t have a room next to the router; you\'re going to have a BAD time. At best we have two bars on our computers; and we\'re relatively close to the front. They definitely need more routers.\n\nAll in all; it\'s basically a ""you get what you pay for"" kind of place.

It\'s a decent apartment for someone on their own for the first time, but I would not want to live here for a long period of time so get out as fast as you can. When you visit the property, don\'t be fooled by the model apartment. Take a close look at the actual apartment you\'ll be renting and you can learn a lot about the quality of these apartments.\n\nMy biggest complaint about living here would be the management. The leasing office lacks two important things: accountability/follow through, and communication. If you ever need something taken care of, your best bet is to go into the office in person. Don\'t bother calling especially if it\'s almost closing time. I\'ve been in there and have seen the staff ignore calls when helping other residents. (Yes they even said, ""Oh it\'s nobody important"" and hit the ignore button when I asked if they needed to pick up the phone. At least asking the resident to be put on hold would be better...) Then, once you have put your issue on the staff\'s radar, you better follow up yourself frequently to make sure it\'s taken care of because half the time they don\'t do what they say they will.\n\nHere\'s my list of other pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n* Close to a lot of businesses on Mill and Southern, also close to the 60 freeway (but not close enough to hear any freeway traffic although you will hear sirens now and then)\n* If you\'re going to ASU, there\'s a bus stop right across the street (line 65/66 I believe) that will take you there directly\n* Plenty of parking spots available, easy to have guests over too because they don\'t have to worry about finding a spot\n* Cheap rent, short-term leases available, pretty big space for what you\'re paying for\n* Pet-friendly\n* Community events put on in conjunction with one of the complexes next door\n* It\'s pretty quiet during the daytime... during the night though you get loud people walking through going to their apartments\n* Emergency maintenance available if you have a flooded toilet etc.\n\nCons:\n* Parking lot has speed bumps every 20-30 feet which is annoying and unnecessary... it doesn\'t matter how slowly you go over them, you\'ll need to get your car checked eventually\n* Cheap quality apartment. Prime example: no real wood anywhere but instead you have faux hardwood floors and the cabinets are painted to look like wood. The countertops and bathtub have ""surfaces"" (so it\'s not a real porcelain tub).\n* They don\'t seem to put much care into fixing up the apartments... when I moved in, I would not say this was a ""move-in ready"" apartment because I had a burnt light bulb among other very small things that would have been easy to take care of. A lot of the trim was badly chipped and they didn\'t repaint it. When they did repaint things like the cabinets, they clearly didn\'t care about taping off the adjacent wall so the paint extended past the cabinet, and some even went on the carpet. (This was all done before I moved in.)\n* Really thin ceilings and walls. Get used to hearing stomping sounds and doors slamming.\n* The way the utilities are split up: everyone in a building pays the same for water and water heating, even if you\'re only 1 person vs. 2 people in the same size apartment. Maybe this is normal procedure but I was being overcharged for water considering I didn\'t use that much at all.\n* Sometimes they post notices on your door that have your full name written on it. Personally I would not want my neighbors to know that much info!\n\nIf you\'re looking for a cheap place to live, it\'s fine but like I said, I wouldn\'t want to live here for more than a few months.

Of course I did, but arriving to my destination was the most important outcome. From 4pm to 9pm, Spirit decided to cancel the flight leaving LAS to San Diego to Portland. Creating an inconvenience to hundreds of travelers crammed into their tiny airbus carrier. Yes--budget means lack of space, but it also means extremely upset individuals. Leaving the gate to the front kiosk where Spirit claims to provide accommodations for all guest, they shorted over 300 individuals. Only providing the options of a refund or a flight the next day with absolutely NO lodging compensation. Why is that you ask? Oh it was because they decided to lie about what they had expressed during the final delay. I was told that there wasn't a mechanical issue--though it was announced several times, that there was bad air traffic and the weather did not permit departure. Sure, that's a great reason to rip us all of.

You'll never know how buffets really are in Vegas unless you take the time to find reviews online. As of recently Caesar's Palace recently renovated and reopened their buffet with a whole new outlook.\n\nWhat you need to know,\nDining plans, it is currently one of the busiest buffets in Vegas right now. If you plan on getting a good meal, this is it. Make sure you get there at least an hour to an hour and a half before you plan on dining. The line can be a ridiculous but well worth the wait. Diamond member? No waiting here just take the exclusive line and you're in! (open 7-10pm)\n\nWhat's the cost?\nBreakfast ~$19\nLunch ~$25\nDinner ~$35\nBuffets of Buffets ~$50 (24 hour window of eating!)\n\nHow's the food?\nPhenomenal, by far the best buffet I've had in my life...so far. There is everything from oysters to ramen. I dined for at least two hours to try to get a taste of each portion. Now you may be a little unease that the portions are small but don't be, it's a buffet!\n\nLets start with some meat. The lamb chop was great, I'm not a big fan but the flavor came together very well. The brisket was a melt in your mouth type of meat, it was so tender that you could sit there and eat it all day. Prime rib for some may be a little rare but the juices made the ribs so rich and tender it was hard to set aside.\n\nSeafood? I didn't have a chance to try much (lines were exceptionally long) but it wasn't the best in my opinion. Crab legs were a little too salty but the good thing is, you don't have to worry about making a mess from cracking shells. The shrimp with cocktail sauce was by far the best shrimp I've had. Large pieces of shrimp with an excellent cocktail sauce beats it all. Now there was a shrimp and grits dish, it had a creamy texture right before you dive into the grits (not my favorite) but again, worth the taste. Lobster bacon cheddar soup, the title itself sounds awesome. Caesar does not hold back on their seafood, you will get a decent amount of lobster in the soup and the bacon just makes it awesome. Take a stab at their seafood! (Sushi is available too but it's too filling for me to have at a buffet)\n\nTaste of Asia? Well, being Chinese/ Vietnamese myself, I'm not a big fan of the Asian cuisine within buffets. I only had the chance to try one thing. It was the ramen, it was good. Definitely not too ramen, folks. The noodles are cooked right before you and you're given a small but a filling bowl. Right after you get your bowl you're given directions to head to the condiments bar with onions, cilantro, jalepens, green onions, and various sauces to add. Raines was all I had but there was an open variety of Chinese Dim Sum dumplings, sushi, noodles, stir fry, and all the little things.\n\nDessert? Who has room for dessert when it comes to buffets? I certainly don't but I had to indulge. There was everything from macaroons to souffl\xe9 to gelato.

I wanted a nice dinner too, don't get me wrong, but I knew a cheap lobster dinner could be found and I wanted us to find it.\n\nWe were there less than 48 hours when dinner found us! We had been walking around Downtown Vegas and seen signs on the Fremont Hotel for an $11.99 steak and lobster dinner. I pointed it out with excitement. Unfortunately, we weren't hungry! But....after a couple more hours strolling and dancing, our appetites caught up and it happened to be between the hours the special was being served!\n\nWe had a 30 minute wait and we were not alone. The waiting area was packed! We were finally sat and our server (George) dropped off menus on his way to take another order. He returned not long after with a smile, even though I'd watched him scurry from table to table in the interim.

Husband ate all of his and said it was about what he expected. We both agreed the lobster was better than expected. They were tiny tails but they were tender and well-seasoned and the drawn butter coated the bites nicely. My green beans were actually terrible. Rubbery and not much garlic to be found.

We had an amazing experience at the Flamingo and they were my 500th review. I had hoped review #1,000 would be for our most recent stay at the Excalibur in Jan 2014. Bleh! What a nightmare. I have a pretty awesome memory, and there were so many horrible things about this experience that I actually had to start writing them down so that I wouldn\'t forget!\n\nWe booked this trip just for fun and because Southwest Airlines had a good deal. It was less than $200 each for four days, our flights, and a rental car, plus $20 hotel food/drink credit. Which honestly is about what you can find anytime for mid-week, off-season in Vegas. The trip was supposed to include all taxes/fees but a mandatory resort fee for use of the fitness center and such was imposed upon arrival. Whatever, it was only $50 more.\n\nThe robot of a woman who checked us in told us there was wifi in the rooms. I asked if it was free wifi and she said yes. While the casino floor has wifi, there is none in the rooms. So her misinformation was a little annoying. But worse than that was that around every corner of the hotel, someone is waiting to ask if you want free show tickets, free dinner, free this, free that. All you have to do is listen to them offer you a deal where you pay up front to come back to Vegas in the next year... blah blah scam.  We also had papers shoved under the door in our room with the same ""please come hear our non-time-share presentation"" bull sh*t written all over them. (As well as different pizza delivery places shoving their ads under our room door.) So much for respecting our vacation privacy. The last thing you want to hear while you\'re getting it on in your Vegas hotel room is some stranger at your door giving you unwanted advertisements. F*ck you, Excalibur.\n\nThe $20 food/drink credit isn\'t valid at the Hotel Buffet which makes absolutely no sense, so we used it at the Steakhouse which was a joke as well. Gross service; average food. Everything about this hotel is below what anyone would consider an acceptable standard. I imagine they once had their glory days... but even the carpet in Tower 2\'s elevators (EVERY elevator) was worn down with holes, exposing the glue. Which was sort of funny since a flooring convention was taking place while we were there. The five minutes of work it would take to lay new carpet is probably something they could\'ve secured a good deal on last week.\n\nWe enjoyed the pool, but the fitness center that our resort fees were paying for was rather small. I still enjoyed it every morning. The adjacent locker rooms are an additional fee with locker rental for $25! Other spa prices were absurd as well. Every morning around 7:30 a.m. we received a new phone message telling us to check out their spa services. Every morning! An overpriced massage from this hotel? No thanks!\n\nOf all the hotels we gambled at (at least 10 or more), Excalibur had the worst drink service. It was non-existent. You\'d think you\'d get a drink if you sit at a machine long enough? Yes, we did. We got one drink the first night we were there. (It happened to be the best hot chocolate we\'d ever tasted in our lives) but in the days that followed we never had the opportunity to get another drink. Walk over to Luxor and gamble there, or head elsewhere on the strip. This place sucks.\n\nThe queen beds in our room on the 20th floor were horrible (room 20228). We slept in one the first night, (or rather, barely slept), and went to switch to the other the second night, in hopes it was better, but there were old blood stains on the sheets so we went back to the first bed. We switched to a king room on the 23rd floor (room 23269) the last night ($5 fee but they waived it for us). The bed was a lot better. Not like a Marriott mattress, but we finally got some good rest. Or perhaps we were just exhausted by then. The pillows were the best thing about the rooms. Soft, plush, large and wonderful. \n\nThe ""contemporary"" rooms had bathrooms from the 80s with little showers spraying water with poor pressure. No bath tubs. At least they appeared clean and the towels were soft. Aside from check-in, the staff we interacted with were nice. Room service people we said hi to in the hallways were friendly and smiling.

We unfortunately planned very poorly and had booked two other things this day: a late lunch and bar show at Kahunaville (prepaid on Groupon) and a naughty (X)Burlesque show to end the night .

AND FOR MY 500TH REVIEW, ....I PICK  FLAMINGO!! \n\nI don't need a lot out of a hotel. I don't go places to sit in a room and I think we only turned our TV on once this trip. So fancy TVs don't impress me and I don't need much more than a comfy, clean bed. Our room had no fridge, no coffee maker, no plasma TV, but it certainly was clean! Perfect!\n\nI was super excited when we checked in on a Saturday afternoon.  We had valeted our car for free and the neither the valet nor check-in lines were very long. Crossing through the casino to get to the room elevators, we could see the garden area outside. Couldn't wait to check this place out!  I've been to LV a million times but never stayed here. Now, I don't know that I'd ever stay anywhere else.\n\nThe walk to our room from the elevator was pretty far. Surprisingly far, but walking is good for us and so I wasn't complaining.  Our room was on the 10th floor and had one lamp with a lightbulb out, a faulty shower with a slippery floor and a broken ice machine on that level. It had pink and black decorations and a very clean wood-like floor. I hate gross carpets so this caught my eye first. One night of sleep and we agreed the bed was comfy but the pillows were not. Bummer - I love lots of fluffy pillows.\n\nThe second day we stopped at customer service and asked for a room closer to the elevator. Lots of people had checked out (since it was Sunday). The lady at the counter hooked us up with a similar room but on the 21st floor, very close to the elevator and with a working ice machine outside. Everything about the room was great and it was very clean.\n\nGood experiences with valet all week. Great experiences with the staff.  Even the cashiers were extra friendly; drink service was fast; and bartenders had heavy pours. Bugsy's Bar is one of our favorites. \n\nWe sat at the pool in the mornings. The GO pool (21 and up) wasn't open yet but will be in a couple of weeks, so it was important to get there early to get a lounge chair in the sun. This was not a problem. I had been getting up early every day. There was a bar at the pool, and you could not bring your own drinks in here. They ID'ed and checked for alcohol. I did notice a couple flasks around though.\n\nOne of the best features of Flamingo is the location. It's on the strip and centrally located. It's not one of the newest hotels but has undergone nice rennovations. We walked lots of places, even though we had a rental car. The watershow at the Fountains of Bellagio are just across the street. Quad is recently rennovated and closeby and Bills is presently undergoing construction. Paris is near, but we really liked the open-ness of the casino rooms at Flamingo best. We went next door to Margaritaville a couple times, since they're connected by a fun bar and some machines we bet pennies on.\n\nThe outside area had waterfalls and fountains, big sitting rocks and wildlife that included turtles, fish, and real flamingos. It was all fantastic. There aren't many stores inside, but there are a few for shopping (even one just for adults with some fun stuff!) and only a few restaurants (I recommend dessert from the steakhouse). The Pizza Joint stayed open till 2am, but we were in bed before that every night. \n\nYou have to pay for the fitness center, but 30 flights of stairs are available for free. Save your money and run on the strip for free. Make sure to do it early because it sure gets HOT in Vegas. Spend that saved money on a show. The X Burlesque show was in the Flamingo and very, very sexy. Make sure to search for cheaper tickets online, and ask for discounts at the Players Club desk.

The contract amount looked about right (because part was prepaid and part was due on return), and I was never shown any contract details before I was asked to sign electronically for the car. \n\nWhen I arrived home and really examined the contract, I found that the employee at the desk had added insurance to the contract without my permission. My online reservation showed NO insurance very clearly.\n\nI called the Hertz reservation line who told me that I had no choice but to go back to the rental location - again, a 40 minute drive on a Sunday night. I tried calling the location repeatedly, but no one would pick up the phone.\n\nSo...I drove. I used gas in the rental car. I was required to pay for that gas. I took over an hour out of my day because of an employee who was trying to earn commission (I learned that counter employees are commissioned on sales of insurance).\n\nWhen I got back to the airport, I asked for a manager. I spoke with the very unsympathetic manager on duty who didn't do much but told me she would give me a coupon for 10% off a future rental - which certainly didn't cover my expenses for the counter employee's fraud. Explaining that I would never rent from Hertz again, I asked if that 10% could be used on the current rental. The manager on duty agreed.\n\nI had originally reserved the car for two days but was so disgusted that I ended up returning it a day early because I didn't want anything to do with Hertz ever again. It was then I found out that the 10% promised by the manager on duty wouldn't be honored.\n\nI've emailed Kyle Oldham, the purported General Manager of the location, and he ignores me. I've contacted Hertz customer service TWICE and recounted my story. The last customer service agent, Melissa (agent ID 7837), to whom I spoke on March 17, 2014, promised me I would receive an email confirmation of my complaint. No such email was ever received. \n\nBottom line, go elsewhere. I've rented all over the US and Europe using Avis, and now I know why.

I kept telling him it wasn't necessary, but he insisted so I finally accepted.\n\nFast forward to July. No refund from David Barton for May as promised, and I didn't really care at that point. I had closed on my house and was in the midst of cleaning, preparing, and moving. It had been a CRAZY two months, and the David Barton Gym was the last thing on my mind.\n\nWhen I finally got a chance to get my files in order after the moving process, I discovered that David Barton Gym had never STOPPED charging my card! I was in possession of cancellation paperwork that indicated no further charges would be made after May, yet I had charges for June and July.\n\nMaking a long story short for the last time, it's August 14 and I STILL haven't received a penny back. I'm left with the conclusion that this place condones fraud and tries to get away with it whenever possible. The General Manager, Greg Refner, has no customer service skills (and no desire to serve or be fair to people) and certainly no urgency for anything...unless it's getting someone to sign membership paperwork under duress. \n\nI am really appalled at the way in which this entire debacle was handled. I'd suggest staying away from this place at all costs, no matter how glamorous it may seem."", u'votes': {u'funny': 4, u'useful': 19, u'cool': 3}, u'stars': 1, u'sentiment': 0.08992945326278665}, {u'text': u""This review is a couple of months overdue, but I still have to write and say that Koby is great!

Keep this in mind.\n\nLet me start by explaining how my car ended up at this auto shop. I was on my way to vegas for EDC, and about 20 miles outside of our destination, my car broke down. I managed to get it towed to Lee's (which was a struggle with AAA but, what are you gonna do.) When I go back the next day to see what's wrong with my car, they tell me to wait while someone goes to check it out. After an hour and a half of waiting, I'm told that the timing chain is broken. \n\nLee's wanted a $1500 deposit up front for parts they were going to order. I looked up how much a timing chain cost online, and it was nowhere near this figure ($300ish if I'm not mistaken). When I asked for the breakdown of everything they wanted to order, the guy helping me begrudgingly listed the parts off rapid-fire. I had to ask him to slow down and repeat himself, to make sure I knew exactly what they wanted $1500 for. Here's what they wanted to order:\n\n-Timing chain kit\n-Intake manifold gaskets\n-Valve cover gaskets\n-Oil pan gaskets\n-Timing cover gaskets\n-Water pump\n-Silicone kit\n-Coolant\n-Oil change\n\nThis seems to me to be a BIT more than just a timing chain. They also said that to repair the car, I was looking at a $2500 starting point, but that the ultimate price would likely be around $3000 for other 'miscellaneous' things they needed to do. They told me they'd call me back on Monday after they've made a thorough examination of the car since I was sure as hell not going to part with $1500 at some unknown auto place in Vegas. They agreed.\n\nMonday rolls around, no call. Tuesday, same deal. I don't think it was Thursday until they called me back to tell me that, actually, the radiator had overheated and damaged the engine, and that my car was totaled. \n\nSo, let me reiterate: they wanted me to drop $1500 on special-order parts (timing chain and all that other unnecessary shit) BEFORE they had actually even TAKEN A LOOK AT MY CAR TO SEE WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS?\n\nWhat a joke. I'm having the car towed to a family member's colleague's mechanic so he can take a look at it and actually tell me what the problem really is, and if there are any other solutions (like, getting a rebuilt engine instead of a new one).\n\nTo get my car out of the shop, I needed to pay the fee for them to look at the car, which came out to $170 (2 hours labor at $85.. steep, but whatever). Then, when I called them back, the price had shot up to over $500. Turns out, the storage fees they said they'd waive were instead included in the price. They wouldn't honor the fees being waived, but I managed to talk them down to a final price of $245. \n\nSo basically: this auto shop is SCAM CENTRAL. All the owners of cars breaking down on the i-15 being towed here are inevitably going to be SCAMMED, just like I was.\n\nDon't let this happen to you. Oh, and those 5 star reviews?

The little sparrow had it's foot caught on the branch and was hanging upside down. It would flutter it's wings valiantly every few minutes trying to right itself, then hang helpless again. I wanted to help, but it was so high up I knew I couldn't climb all the way up. One of the staff members came out to see if everyone was happy so I pointed out the little bird and asked her if they had a long pole of some kind. She went back inside and came out with a ladder and a broom. So she set up the ladder and I was preparing to climb up with the broom stick to see if I could help free the bird.  Meanwhile everyone on the patio and passing by had stopped to see what was happening. I was about to climb up when another staff member came out to assess the situation. He quickly came up with a better solution and disappeared inside. Shortly he returned with an extendable pole that would easily reach the sparrow. After gently trying to nudge the bird free we all realized the entaglement was more serious. This kind man climbed the tree and with the help of another volunteer on the ground pulled the branch close enough to reach. He then gently captured the bird and brought it down. Both of its feet were badly tangled with some sortof stringy moss. The bird's thrashing had twisted ithe string so badly he would surely have died before breaking free. Everyone helped to untangle his feet and then we set the tiny sparrow free.

The taste was still good, but I expect to at least get a warm ear of corn. One of the rows was almost cold enough to still be considered frozen.\n\nThen I started on the fries and ribs. The fries were O.K. They were beer battered. The beer batter had no flavor to it at all. It just gave the fries an extra crunch to them. All-in-all not worth the extra calories. The fries were just fries. The taste was alright but there was no zing to them. The best part of the meal was the ribs. They were very tender and had a lot of flavor. The only thing you need to watch out for is the B.B.Q. Sauce. It is slathered on so thick there is just as much of it as the ribs. The taste of the sauce was very good. You could taste the combination of the tomatoes, brown sugar, and vinegar for acidity. It was a good combination, just way to thick.\n\nTo wash everything down I had an Iced Tea.

It was very flavorful like you would expect it to be. The veggies were tasty and crisp and the ham on the Hawaiian was plentiful and flavorful. One thing very interesting about the bacon bits on the Hawaiian; they were bacon fried up and cut into bits. So they were very moist and full of flavor and most of all they were not hard and overly crunchy. The sauce was tomato-ie like sauce should be.

This person was the host, wait staff, and cashier. Once I was seated I was attended too very well, at least until I was ready to go. Then I did have to wait several minutes again until my check was brought to me. Even though I mention this I do have to say that I don\'t feel that I had to wait an excessive amount of time. Just a bit more time and it would have been excessive, but it did not reach that for me.\n\nI started with a house salad. It had a mixture of lettuces that were very enjoyable. I did of course have to select my favorite salad dressing, which I am sorry to tell you is Thousand Island. I am sorry to tell you that not because I think there is anything wrong with Thousand Island; but most people consider it a kids salad dressing and an adult should get Blue Cheese or Italian or something as fancy. I don\'t mind fancy dressings, but TI is still my favorite. Their Thousand Island was done very well. It was just the right consistency, not to thin or too thick. It had a nice flavor to it as well. It was not acidic or sweet. It was a nice balance of both.\n\nMy entree was a Meatball Parmesan Calzone. When I received my Calzone I was stunned. This Calzone was so large I did not know if I would be able to finish it (I did not). The Calzone was the size of a football cut in half horizontally. The crust was very flaky with a nice pizza dough flavor and texture. You could feel the texture of the gluten in a good way. The Calzone contained four meatballs. Each was the size of a lime. Sometimes restaurants have a tendency to overwork their meat. Meatballs and Meatloaf are more like slimyballs or slimyloaf. This was not the case in my Calzone. The meatballs had the proper consistency and were flavored wonderfully. The four meatballs lay in a bed of Parmesan cheese. This cheese was nice and stringy and had a great flavor. It chewed nicely. There was no sauce in the Calzone itself. There was a serving of marinara on the side for dipping. The combination of crust, meatball, cheese and marinara worked very well. I so much wanted to finish my Calzone but wanted to have dessert.\n\nI decided to try their Zappoli. The description itself made me put on five pounds. \'Fried dough tossed with powdered sugar and topped with chocolate and raspberry sauces\'. Sounds good, doesn\'t it. The description does not do it justice. The Zappoli was served on a round plate 12"" across. You might laugh and think I am exaggerating. Let me tell you, I am being truthful. This dessert was made to serve at least four people. There were about three dozen of the fluffy, lighter that air Zapploi. In the center was a large lovely pile of whipped cream also covered with the chocolate and raspberry. But, there were also four more piles of whipped cream equidistant around the edge of the plate. Again, covered with the sauces. Each bite was a bit of heaven. I did have to stop though. More and I would have made myself sick. All of this with my drink was only $20.00 (prices subject to change). I do highly recommend a trip to Uncle Angelo\'s Pizza Joint. But only if you take a few friends to help you eat all that they put in front of you.', u'votes': {u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}, u'stars': 4, u'sentiment': 0.17359375}, {u'text': u""Burgers, shakes, an awesome seat on the Las Vegas Strip. What more can you ask for? Nothing, I say. Strip Burger is located at the North end of the Fashion Show Mall on the Las Vegas Strip. Most of the seating is outdoors with a great view of the Wynn and Encore hotels. There is some seating inside for the colder months we have here in Vegas, so don't worry about the weather if you want to stop in for some great American fare.\n\nStrip Burger has the usual drink selection of soft drinks and beers. Something there to satisfy any thirst. But if you want something more that just something to drink, Strip Burger also has a homemade shake. The shakes come in several flavors such as vanilla, chocolate, strawberry and cookies & cream. Each shake is so creamy and flavorful you will be asking if free refills are provided. No they are not. I was saddened at this. If you need something to cool you off when the weather is a bit hotter I can guaranty a Strip Burger Shake will hit the spot. Give it a try and you will see for yourself.\n\nIf fresh cut fries are your thing, make your way to Strip Burger. Their fries have a great potato taste, are perfectly cooked and just lightly salted with a coarse salt. They also offer sweet potato fries and one of my favorite things, fried onion strings. The onion strings are like onion rings, but they are not greasy and they are thin and crunchy. A real taste treat.\n\nA Strip Burger burger may not be Angus Beef, but Angus is not always the only choice for a really good burger. The beef used in their burger is flavorful, juicy and keeps it's form well. The burger seems to be a third pound. The bun is soft, tasty and holds the burger very well. They do their burger several different ways all providing a flavor sensation in your mouth. I get the bacon cheddar burger now when I go. The bacon has a bit of a crunch to it but is not overcooked. The cheddar is nice and thick and complements the beef nicely. When you bite into your burger for the first time the juices flow and the meat provides a nice texture and flavor. This is not the best burger I have ever had, but it is very close.\n\nSome restaurants can have bad days. Both in service and food quality. Strip Burger has had neither when I have been there. The servers and very friendly and are always there when you need something. Everything is brought to your table in a timely manner and picked up just as quickly when you are done. And the outdoor seating provides an open feel.

I was not expecting such good food. The buffet is not very big but what they have is big on flavor. The roast beef was succulent and had a flavor that lets you know what a good beef tastes like.

My steak was prepared just as I had ordered it. Medium rare all the way through. That taste was wonderful. Some times I have ordered steak and had to add some salt to give it some flavor. That was not the case with this Rib Eye. It was tender, juicy, and full of flavor the way a good steak should be.\n\nI choose a Potatoes Au Gratin as my side dish. The potatoes were about an eight of an inch cubed. I am not used to potatoes being served that way. Especially an Au Gratin. I tell you though, this was one of the best Potatoes Au Gratin I have ever tasted. The cheese in the potatoes let you know it was there, but did not mask the taste of the perfectly cooked potato. The seasonings were just right. I did not have to add any extra seasonings. I do have to say, if the order were doubled, it still would not have been enough. And the order that came was not small.\n\nMy wife had the lamb and a side of mashed potatoes. My steak was so much I did not taste the lamb. I had a few bites of the mashed potatoes though. The potatoes were so fluffy and light. Whenever I have had potatoes that fluffy in the past, they were also watery. These were not like that at all. They were so light, fluffy and tasty they seemed as if they could just float away. My wife tells me me lamb was very tasty and cooked to a perfect medium rare. This evening my wife and I choose just to have water to drink. So, no info about the wines they have. Sorry.\n\nThe service was pretty good. It started off excellent, but at some point they might have gotten overwhelmed. There was a period of over ten minutes that no one came by our table to give me a refill on my water.

The other shakes were a dollar more, so the combo was a dollar more as well. You could get onion rings though. They were the same cost as the fries so no problem there.

Large portions and a lot of taste. If you go for lunch or dinner make sure you save room for a Cinnamon roll. They can be shared between two people, but you will probably want one for yourself. Other than home made, these are some of the best Cinnamon rolls I have ever had.\n\nOne last suggestion is to get a cup of coffee. The coffee is smooth with not much bite, but flavorful. It is some of the best diner coffee I have ever had. Thank you to Tiny Nalor and the Nalor family for starting Du-Pars. This is a real classic not to be missed.\n\nOne last thing.

When you first walk in there a few picnic tables and some benches with tables to sit on, but only a few. That's because Hogs Heaven's claim to fame is their delivery. But the place was packed anyway. The menu is a simple one that most Barbeque enthusiasts will love. Ribs, pulled pork and sides. A lot of people will tell you the only true Barbeque is Pork Shoulder. A finely cooked Pork Shoulder will make the best pulled pork sandwiches. Hogs Heaven has that as one of their signature dishes. I do have to say that I cannot tell you about the Pulled Pork this time. I did not try them, but there were a lot of happy customers eating them. I had to go for my favorite BBQ item as it was my first time at Hogs Heaven. My wife and I shared a full rack of Baby Back Ribs. (We had leftovers) I have to say that these ribs are in my top few of the best ribs I have ever eaten. When you grabbed onto them with your teeth they just came off the bone. They were so tender, juicy and succulent, and their Barbeque sauce was so tasty. Their Barbeque sauce is a vinegar based Barbeque sauce. I have found few of those in my lifetime that I have enjoyed. But, the vinegar taste was so understated that it just enhanced the flavors of the other ingredients and the ribs. Hogs Heaven has won me over to vinegar based Barbeque sauces.\n\nAs our sides of choice this time, my wife and I choose their BBQ Skillet Beans and a Corn on the Cob. The corn was fully cooked but still had a very nice crunch to it. The flavor of the corn was not overpowering at all. It just tasted like a good corn should. It was also very juicy. The beans were a big surprise. They looked like a regular serving of BBQ beans, but the flavor was indescribable. These were the best beans I have ever had. There was a little smokiness to them, but just a hint. It caught me off guard to see red Bell Peppers in the beans but they were a great addition with good flavor from the sauce. When I go back I will be sure to include the BBQ Skillet Beans every time. Their side dishes also include Potato Salad, Mac & Cheese, Coleslaw, Fried Okra, and Collard Greens. They also have Hog Fries to go with your meal. The menu also includes Buffalo and BBQ wings as well as a Mini Pulled Pork Sandwich, Mini BBQ Corn Dogs, and Animal Chic Fingers for the kids.\n\nFor dessert my wife and I shared a Peach Cobbler. I usually am not one for Peach Cobbler. But I enjoyed this one very much. The flavor of the peaches was subtle and combined well with the other ingredients. The crisp portion was a bit doughy and tasted more like a donut to me. My wife did not care for it that much, but I enjoyed it.\n\nAs I said, the place is small. But it is very cute. I enjoyed the ambiance. The staff are very friendly. They were by our table several times to make sure everything was OK. When we were ready to go they brought us a to-go container for our leftovers without our even having to ask. I asked about their delivery area and I was told that if you buy a minimum of $40.00 worth of food they will deliver anywhere in Las Vegas for only a $2.50 delivery fee. That is just two full racks of ribs if you are feeding four people.\n\nI can tell you that I will be going back to Hogs Heaven again and again."", u'votes': {u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}, u'stars': 4, u'sentiment': 0.2874702380952381}, {u'text': u""The first thing I have to say about Miller's Ale House is the Burger is Great. One  thing I love is a good burger. I thought I would give theirs a try as it was my first time at the Ale House. When the burger arrived, a big portion of it was hanging over the edge of the bun. I took a healthy bite of the meat all by itself. What a pleasure that was. The meat was moist while being cooked properly. The flavor had a savoriness that did not mask the beefiness. This tasted like a good piece of beef should. I got the British burger that has Swiss Cheese and Bacon on top. Every aspect of the burger were done properly. Even the bun served well. It was not too soft or hard and complemented the rest of the sandwich.\n\nMy wife got the fish and chips, so I gave the fish a try. Not bad at all.

No servers on roller skates though, darn. The menu is primarily Burgers, Dogs, Chili and Shakes. There is more, but that is what most of the menu is. The burgers are made of Sirloin Steak. The patties are about 2oz each. So they are thin and have a bit of crunch at the outer edge. The burgers are served medium well. This is a very good burger. The fries are part way between a shoestring and regular sized fry. They have a nice flavor and a good crunch because of their thickness.\n\nThe shakes are hand scooped. The combinations of shake flavors is almost limitless. The thing about the shakes that I like the most is that they are twice a large as you would expect them to be. They taste great and have a very creamy\ntexture. They are also chilled nicely and hit the spot.\n\nThe service is fast. They get to your table quickly. They bring the food quickly. The tables are cleared quickly. The only issue I had was that I did not see many smiles on the workers faces. A few, but most did not.

I didn't want to seem unfair after just one visit since it has reopened. I had been several times in the past and loved it, for inexpensive food. But they closed and the location became a Coco's. A little while back the Coco's closed down and the Grand Cafe reopened. My wife and I were so excited. We gave it a try expecting the good food at low prices we had gone back again and again for. We went back again a few nights ago to have dinner with some friends. I am sorry to say that both my wife and I are very disappointed.\n\nThe Grand Cafe is clean; as a matter of fact it is very clean. I give them a lot of credit for that. But the restaurant itself is just kinda drab. It looks OK, but nothing jumps out at you.\n\nThe service is spotty. Sometime they are very attentive, and other times they are not. This was the same when the Grand Cafe was there before the Coco's and seems to be the same now. The other night I finished my beverage 3/4 of the way through dinner and was not asked if I wanted a refill until I was being handed the check; well after we had all finished and were ready to depart.\n\nThe taste of the food seems not to be very good any more. I have had the meatloaf & the Prime Rib. The veggies with both dishes were pretty good. The potatoes with each dish were OK as well, but nothing to write about. The meatloaf was very, very bad. The meat had been highly over mixed and had a almost slimy texture to it. There was no flavor to it at all. I had to add massive amounts of salt just to make it palatable. My wife had gotten the spaghetti and meatballs that night. They were awful. The sauce was sickly sweet and the meatballs were just like my meatloaf; disgusting. The other night I had ordered my Prime Rib medium rare. It came out medium well. And after it was cut, they had thrown on the grill. There was no pink to it at all. It was charred in some places and looked more like a stark that a Prime Rib. The flavor was acceptable, but just. All in all I am going to try my best to avoid going back.

I have to say that I was very impressed with the brunch. Lunches and dinners have been very lacking, but this Brunch was very good. The bacon was cooked just right. It had a wonderful flavor and it and was cooked as to be not to crunchy or limp. I had a slice of ham that was so succulent and tender. I also tried three different types of potatoes. I had some mashed, au gratin, and hash browns. Each was done quite nicely and had a good flavor to them. Most of the time when I have fruit at the Feast Buffet it is not flavorful at all. This time both the watermelon and honeydew were very juicy and flavorful. I grabbed a bit of cherry cobbler and was impressed. The cherries were not to tart or sweet. The cobbler had a nice texture and flavor to it. It wasn't the best I have ever had, but I did enjoy it.\n\nWe were seated pretty quickly.

It has a nice atmosphere. It was a long time before someone even greeted us. When they finally did we were told we were ignored was because they had just got slammed and were letting the kitchen catch up. I might have bought it but I have read too many reviews of the Meatball Spot that have said the same thing. And the service never really got much better.

I do not go in for all the fancy toppings and condiments, so I just got the American Burger. Lettuce, Tomato, onion, cheese and one perfectly cooked 1/2 pound piece of meat. If anyone has ever had burgers and other cuts of beef that were OK; this is the burger that will let you know how a good piece of beef should taste.

The wheel was completely in true, and dished to accommodate the 7-speed freehub.\n\nThe second time was a bit more interesting. As I'm all over the valley, I had a modern bottom bracket installed on my bicycle at another shop, and put some new cranks on it. On it's maiden ride with a new bottom bracket and crankset, the non-drive crank arm fell off. Being in Mesa at the time, I walked the bike over to Paragon (much to the dismay of my friends who I was riding with), Ray looked at it and immediately knew what was wrong and threw the bike on the repair stand and fixed the problem: the other shop put some spacers onto the bottom bracket in a fashion intended for mountain bikes, even though it was a road bike. He removed the offending spacers, installed the crank, and we were off.\n\nEven in very usual or exigent circumstances, the guys at Paragon have done nothing but splendid work for me, and their work costs always end up being cheaper than their initial quotes.

I almost regret having ever tried it as I have easily gained 5 pounds since my first visit 3 months ago.

In fact I have been driving past this establishment for years and never paid it any attention though I remember the parking lot has often been full. The building does not catch your eye unlike the Castle Boutique whose entrance is opposite of the parking area for Times Square. Inside the d\xe9cor is simple, not overdone, and the hand drawn images on framed napkins in the bar area depicting numerous faces are unique.  There are multiple flat screen TV\'s playing sporting events just in case ""the game"" happens to conflict with dinnertime.  \n\nOur first experience was with a group of 6 during a Friday evening rush in December. Our server was well versed in all menu items, patient, quick to take our drink & appetizer orders and just as quick to serve in spite of the bustling bistro. She returned, personable and unfrazzled, to check on how everything was and to see if we needed anything at just the right times. It doesn\'t matter that I don\'t recall her name, all servers here are equally adept and there are plenty of them on hand to take care of customer needs each time we come here, which is usually during the 6 - 7 PM rush on a Friday or Saturday. Keep in mind, though, this place is almost just as busy during Sunday - Thursday evenings as well so expect to wait a few minutes to be seated if you haven\'t made reservations. I would like to mention that we were not charged gratuity on our group of 6, which resulted in a great tip for our server; she earned it!\n\nThere is a well stocked bar attended by welcoming bartenders to address your thirst requirements, be they in the form of alcohol, water, or amazing food.

If we could have taken him home we would have. \n\nNow for the food: For appetizers, my husband is a HUGE fan of the crab cakes served with pesto mayo and lemon wedges while I enjoy the fresh bruschetta. My favorite entr\xe9e so far is the Penne Alla Aribiatta without chicken or sausage. I am a vegetarian and have been told by the servers that I am welcome to order just about anything on the menu without meat and the chef will be happy to prepare it. This dish, however, is so ridiculously flavorful that I have not been able to bring myself to order other entrees just yet. In time. \nOther fantastic items on the menu (according to my meat eating spouse): Pasta Giovanni, Spaghetti Alla Polpetti (homemade meatballs he fell in love with and can no longer live without), and the best Caesar Salad that has yet to grace his taste buds - I\'ll have to take his word since I don\'t do eggs either. He has had numerous other items and has loved them all. \n\nThis establishment is squeaky clean and very well run. This place is so popular they are in the process of opening a new location at 7th Street and Union Hills. They have been actively training new chefs since we became patrons in December 2013. \n\nTip #1: Reservations recommended, especially during the dinner rush. They take reservations for 5 or more but not after 3 PM for the same day. If making a reservation was not an option for you, grab a beverage from the bar and your table will be ready as efficiently as is humanly possible. They are very accommodating and the mouth-watering food and out of this world service are well worth the wait. \n\nTip #2: There are several more dishes/specialties on their menu in person than you will find in the online version, though the web version is quite considerable and gives you a good feel for what to expect. \n\nTip #3: There is ample parking out back if the front lot is full. \n\nTip #4: Lastly, but certainly not least, wear your buffet pants and make regular exercise part of your daily routine because you will quickly become as addicted as the rest of the crowd who has been fortunate enough to find this place. \n\nThat\'s it for my 2 cents!', u'votes': {u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 1}, u'stars': 5, u'sentiment': 0.21731103326498058}, {u'text': u'I have the lunch buffet here often with my daughter and with friends.

For me it all started on a warm August day in the late eighties.  I was heading north from Tucson to start my undergrad career at ASU and the friend I was following drove straight to Ted\'s instead of Manzanita (Spanish for ""tall ugly dorm with many drunk kids"").  Thus began a love affair that only grows stronger to this day.  Footlong Chili Dogs got me through a lot of hangovers and somewhere along the way college came and went, grunge came and went and my mullet came and went.  Then after college it was the All Beef Jumbo that got me through the trials and tribulations of being young, single, and semi-gainfully employed -- a few less hangovers, but still plenty of nitrates.  Then as a slightly older family man the White Hot has emerged as the sausage of choice for weekend trips with the Toddlers.  I even purchased my most recent residence perhaps partially because Spiro (the owner and son of ""The Ted"") lives across the street (ok - so maybe not the best approach to real estate decisions, but clealy Hot Dog obsessions can\'t be blamed for the entire real estate bubble).  This place is one of the last old school ASU spots and I pray that Spiro has a succession plan in place if he ever decides to retire.\n\nUpdate: It just occured to me that this posting could be a bit more ""review-ish"" and a bit less autobiographical, so here goes.  All the aftermentioned dogs are awesome.  The condiments are perfect...the mustard and ""hot sauce"" are proprietary and worth purchasing in jars to take home (the white hot with mustard, hot sauce, onions, and a pickel is as good as it gets).  The Chili is ideally matched with cheese and onions on the regular, footlong, and all beef jumbo.  The onion rings are the best in town.

Well seasoned and a nice smoky flavor.\n\nI also loved the bottom sirloin (flank steak), the ribeye, and of course the filet. The beef ribs were also tasty (what we call brisket)\n\nThe side are also delicious. The little bread like popover things are little bites of heaven. The fried polenta sticks are delicious and the fried plantains offer some good sweetness.\n\nSo the meat keeps coming until you flip the card back to red. I usually wait way too long to do that. I ate wayyyyyy too much last night. I think I have gout this morning. My brother may have died. \n\nSome great quotes from our table:\n\n""That last swallow didn\'t feel right""\n""They are going to have to crank up the AC in here if I eat any more.""\n""I\'ve got a bad case of the meat sweats going here""\n\nLove this place.

We had a problem about 2 months ago when multiple indoor outlets and lights and all of out backyards electrics went out. This included our sprinkler/drip system and all of the plants started to suffer. I get on yelp. Look for electricians in the area and mr sparky shows up with a few good reviews. Now I didn\'t see the reviews for the other local mr sparks otherwise I would have stayed away. \n\nAnyhow, they were nice on the phone and said they would send someone out the next day. The 2 guys who showed up were super nice and seemed to know what they were doing. They told me the likely problems and told me what it would cost to really diagnose and fix the issues. They quoted me about $350 at the times.\n\nThen the bleeding began. Multiple knocks on the door saying they found more problems. The dude wrote up 3 plans and the given costs. Lots of scary words like melting wires, not up to code, and danger if not fixed were used. Suddenly I\'m replacing half the breakers in the main box. At the end of the 2 hour visit I get my bill for around $1000 dollars. Everything is working and although I certainly have some sticker shock, the job is done.\n\nA few weeks ago I meet up with an old friend who happens to be an electrician. This visit gets brought up. He basically explains that I probably got taken and I paid a 500% markup for 2 hours of work and no more than $75 bucks in parts. Awesome. I have a beer with my buddy and forget about the whole ordeal.\n\nThis week my phone rings. It\'s someone from mr sparkys sister company Easy air and heat. They explain to me that when I was visited by mr sparky I also paid for a air conditioning tune up. Shady.....no one every said anything about that when I was getting gouged. I tell them to go ahead and come out. Today they show up. Check out my ac unit, which has been working fine and Is only 2.5 years old. I am told the capacitor is not working right and needs to be fixed or it\'s going to ""explode and leak acid all over"". I am told this will cost $290 dollars. I say no thanks and that I would need to go through my home warranty company. He then tells me that if they come out they will say there is nothing wrong and not fix it. I still say no thanks and he leaves. \n\nI\'m thinking after the first visit I go added to their ""sucker"" list. Their work may have all been appropriate. What do I know?  But all the other reviews seem to be pretty consistent. \n\nDon\'t make the same mistake....\n\n2 stars because they were nice and fixed my problem.

I realized before I ordered that this Indian food is intended to be a more healthy style of Indian food so I wasn't sure what to think. Once I Dug in I could definitely tell that it was a lighter style of Indian food, still had all the great flavors but it wasn't has heavy as the Indian food I normally eat is. All the sauces were awesome. All the veggies were really fresh. The style and the way you order is pretty cool because you can see everything right in front of your face and mix and match with your dish. I can't really think of anything bad to say about the place, I did like some sauces more than others but nothing was bad. I def plan to stop in more often. \n\nTHE LONGER STORY for ya readers out there.... \nThe Vindaloo was really awesome. Perfect amount of spiciness to it and def a must have for next time. \nThe curry was probably my favorite. It was really really good, I could mix that with just about anything at home. Not oily, not to much flavoring. I'd love to buy a jug of it and smother some wings. \nThe masala was also really good and I def didn't leave any behind. \nThe mint chutney was really cool.

I liked how it was cold too. \nThere was also a hot sauce that they gave to me on my plate and it definitely has some Kick but it's got really good flavor too.  It was perfect because most of their sauces are pretty mild but I like some heat added so it worked out well. \nAll in all, I'll definitely go back.

The stadium itself is nice, but not the best place for a concert, especially one with such a grand set-up and special effects.

Since that element was a conscious effort on the band\'s part, imagine a show where that wasn\'t the intention -- you\'d feel even farther away from the performers. \n\nIt sorta felt like the venue was competing with, rather than supporting, the music.

Add to the name recognition the fact that they accepted our Marriott points, and were ""so close to the {University of Phoenix} Stadium you could throw a rock and hit it"", and it sounded like a winner. \n\nWell, almost.\n\nThis place was a BITCH to find because (1) the facility is too new to appear on maps and didn\'t show up on the GPS and (2) we took the staff\'s statements literally. Not one, not two, but THREE employees had told me on the phone, prior to my booking the reservation, that this place was ""right across the parking lot from the Stadium"". They said that a car was optional; that the walking distance was very close, and you could see the stadium from the hotel. So, upon locating the Stadium, (it\'s huge and hard to miss), we drove in circles, trying to spot this elusive hotel. \n\nWe called, and told them that we\'d been told it was right across from the Stadium parking lot. ""Yeah, we\'re right here."" Huh? We kept circling the frickin place, wondering if this SH was invisible. Called again, and were told enough to get us there, but it turned out to be nowhere near the Stadium. The only hotel near the Stadium was the Renaissance, followed by the Hampton. \n\nObviously we were really ticked off at being misled on the location. WTF is wrong with those people? Can they not judge distance? Are they looking through binoculars? Come on. Yes, technically it\'s walking distance, but a long one. Not comfortably walkable if you have any health issues, are not in athletic footwear, nor have the energy after many hours in the stadium. Certainly NOT ""right across the parking lot.""  It\'s not even in the nearest shopping center to the Stadium. Thank goodness we had a rental car and had not depended on walking, which we\'d briefly considered based on the information we\'d been given!\n\nIf this is the line they\'re supposed to give out-of-towners who are there to go to the Stadium, it\'s dead wrong and should be changed. \n\nOn to the hotel itself...\n\nThe building is new, and it shows. Everything\'s beautiful, especially the courtyard, which is shared with Residence Inn. There\'s a big fountain which provided great photo ops. Very pretty. The gentleman who checked us in even obliged us some picture-taking so we could get in the shot with our friends. Cool! \n\nThe room itself had a wonderful layout. The living/office area was semi-walled off from the sleeping area, so someone could go to bed and not be disturbed by someone staying up. The bathroom was totally decent, with an added feature of a built-in shelf raised off the counter so I could set toiletries and hair/makeup tools out without being cramped. Great idea! The tub was very shallow, and the granite installation was clearly cheap. Would rather have an acrylic surround done properly than look at ugly cracks. But, whatever. \n\nThere was a flat TV sitting on the dresser that could be angled to view either from bed or from the desk/chairs -- nice touch. \n\nThe pool was an impressive size (but we didn\'t use it -- too cold at the 7 a.m. hour), as was the hot tub. Unfortunately the hot tub suffered from misfiring jets. All they did was make a mess. I think it\'s got to be a Marriott affliction, because the Residence we stayed in earlier this year had the same problem to a much worse degree. Get a real contractor to build those things, I know they\'re out there! No excuse. It was also so over-chlorinated that our eyes stung and noses wrinkled just to get near it. SUCH a waste of time, even though we only spent about a minute in there. We never saw anyone else use the hot tub or pool in three days.\n\nThe buffet breakfast was well-stocked and things were cooked well. The only omission? Potatoes. They had cereals, pastries, bread, yogurt, milk, juices, coffee, tea, cocoa, ready-made cheese/egg omelettes, eggs, sausage patties, English muffins, fruit, and an employee on hand to help. We were overall quite satisfied with the breakfast. \n\nThe beds were really comfortable, with lots of great pillows. It\'s nice to stay in a facility that\'s so new, it hasn\'t had a chance to get gross yet! The toilet paper was cheap and scratchy, but I\'m used to that at Marriotts, so I brought our own. The hair conditioner in the room was half used. When we called for more, it was brought to us no problem.\n\nCan\'t imagine that we\'d stay here again, as we had a pretty singular reason to need to be so close to the Stadium, but we\'d recommend it to others with the warning not to believe anyone who says it\'s right across the parking lot from the Stadium. If you\'re not parking at the Stadium, be prepared for a walk.

My wife and I decided to dine here with some reluctance since we did not care for the former restaurant ""Cabo"" very much at all. But we are glad we took the chance. The new menu is pretty cheap and relatively simple with your normal American-Mexican fare such as burritos, tacos, chimichangas, flautas, etc... When we sat down they have us a basket of chips and three salsas. A salsa verde, a picante, and refried beans (ok not really a salsa). All were quite good. For dinner  I had the beef chimichanga and let me tell you, it may be the best chimi I\'ve ever had. They didn\'t use typical beef but birria which if you don\'t know, is beef that slow cooks in a broth with peppers, onions, cilantro, etc for 4 hours or so which makes the beef very savory and tender.  The chimichanga was fried perfectly. Usually it\'s a big greasy mess but here it was very lightly friend and added a nice crispness to it. My chimi was accompanied with beans and rice which were fine, about as good as beans and rice can be I suppose.  \n\nTo drink I had a big ol 36oz beer. My wife however, first ordered a margarita which was pretty tasty. It seems like here in Vegas they tend to go a little heavy on the triple sec but not this one was nicely done. Her next drink was a Coconut Lime Margarita that was innovated in house by one of their bartenders. I was skeptical as I don\'t care for sweet drinks but this was good! Not sweet at all! \n\nSo overall we had an excellent experience here and we\'ll be sure to come back often. I give it 5 stars cause it was excellent service, great prices, and surprisingly good food.

I must say, the atmosphere was better than I expected.  The band was a GREAT country rock band.  \n\nUnfortunately the place is much much much too small for a band of that caliber and 2-step dancing.  This tiny little place had a tiny little dance floor where you were literally dancing right up into the singer's face.  3 couples at best could dance in there without running into each other.  The band is so close to the customers that you cannot hear a thing anybody says.  So you can rule out conversation. \n\nThere are very few tables and they were all completely full before we even arrived around 9pm.  No biggie, we can stand.  However...where do you put your drink when you want to dance?  We were standing right next to a table of people who were doing nothing but sitting. Not even a drink on the table.  So we would  occasionally set our drinks on the table.  The waitress proceeds to tell me that we are being rude by doing so.  Huh?  They had NOTHING on the table.  How am I being rude to set my drink down to go dancing?  If anything, those people were rude for taking a table and not ordering any drinks.  She should be telling them to move rather than telling off paying customers.  \n\nThe waitresses only serve tables. The bar is much too crowded to leave your space and try to make your way to the bar to get a drink.  \n\nCustomers are like sardines in a can. You can't help but feel up everyone around you because you are constantly being pushed, knocked and tousled into people.  If you meet some odd character that you want to get away from, good luck.  There is no way out and nowhere to go without being seen.\n\nBottom line, great idea but the space is much too small. They need to expand into adjacent areas or change the venue to something more like an acoustic guitar player, lounge type place rather than a multi piece band with dancing.   It just doesn't work in such a small space. \n\nI give it 3 stars for the great band and having a good idea.
